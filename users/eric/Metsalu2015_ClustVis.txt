ABSTRACT
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely
used method of reducing the dimensionality of highdimensional data, often followed by visualizing two of
the components on the scatterplot. Although widely
used, the method is lacking an easy-to-use web interface that scientists with little programming skills
could use to make plots of their own data. The same
applies to creating heatmaps: it is possible to add
conditional formatting for Excel cells to show colored heatmaps, but for more advanced features such
as clustering and experimental annotations, more
sophisticated analysis tools have to be used. We
present a web tool called ClustVis that aims to have
an intuitive user interface. Users can upload data
from a simple delimited text file that can be created
in a spreadsheet program. It is possible to modify
data processing methods and the final appearance
of the PCA and heatmap plots by using drop-down
menus, text boxes, sliders etc. Appropriate defaults
are given to reduce the time needed by the user to
specify input parameters. As an output, users can
download PCA plot and heatmap in one of the preferred file formats. This web server is freely available
at http://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/.
INTRODUCTION
With the advent of high-throughput experiments, scientists
are often confronted with multivariate data, usually presented as a matrix. This type of data can come from a variety of sources, for example gene expression studies where
looking at specific genetic pathways is of great interest (1).
In addition to that, image analysis algorithms can be used
on high resolution images to extract features relevant for
clinical cancer prognosis (2). Heatmap and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are the two popular methods for analyzing this type of data.
* To

Heatmap is a data matrix visualizing values in the cells by
the use of a color gradient. This gives a good overview of
the largest and smallest values in the matrix. Rows and/or
columns of the matrix are often clustered so that users can
interpret sets of rows or columns rather than individual
ones. PCA is a method where a multivariate data set is linearly transformed into a set of uncorrelated variables, ordered in descending manner by the variance explained (3).
This way, one can interpret first few components that often
explain large amount of the variation.
The observations under investigation often have predefined experimental annotation groups and adding this information to both of the plots would make the interpretation easier. For example, it would be possible to see whether
some of the sample groups overlap with each other or form
separate clusters. Without specific statistical software, this
type of analysis is usually not straightforward and needs the
software to be installed and configured.
For example, conditional formatting can be applied in
MS Excel to show a color gradient, but it is not easy to
cluster or annotate the matrix. A proprietary Excel addin called NumXL allows the calculation of principal components, but showing the groups is again more complicated. The similar applies to Galaxy web server (galaxyproject.org) and popular statistics software (for example R,
SAS, Statistica) which allow performing PCA and plotting
heatmap but showing annotations and customizing the output is still quite complicated for an average user. An Excel embedded application called imDEV (4) also allows to
make PCA plots and heatmaps but needs installation on a
specific platform. None of the alternative tools described allows to load a public gene expression data set directly, there
is always some pre-processing needed outside the tool.
We present a web tool called ClustVis that aims to make
this type of analysis easier. The user can upload his/her own
data or alternatively use one of the built-in public gene expression microarray data sets from ArrayExpress (5). Both
heatmap and PCA plot can be generated and modified in a
variety of ways using an intuitive user interface.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Implementation
ClustVis is written using Shiny web application framework
(R package version 0.10.2.1) for R statistics software (6). We
have used BoxPlotR (7) as an example application. ClustVis
uses several R packages internally, including ggplot2 (8) for
PCA plot, pheatmap (R package version 0.7.7) for plotting
heatmap, pcaMethods (9) for different methods to calculate
principal components using data that contain missing values, FactoMineR (10) to calculate confidence ellipses, RColorBrewer (R package version 1.0–5) (11) for color palettes,
shinyBS (R package version 0.20) for tooltips, g:Profiler (12)
for converting gene names etc. ClustVis is freely available
without login requirement at http://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/.
Detecting delimiter and number of annotations
For user-uploaded data sets, ClustVis detects automatically
both, the delimiter and the number of annotation rows from
the data by default. In order to find the delimiter, it counts
for each possible delimiter (comma, tabulator, semicolon)
how many times it appears on each row. We use the heuristic
where minimum is taken over all rows and the delimiter with
the greatest score is chosen as the right one.
When finding number of annotations, at first, all rows
containing any non-numeric data are considered annotations. If the last row before non-integer numeric data contains only integers (for example, sex coded as 0 for male and
1 for female), this one, as well as all preceding rows are considered annotation rows.
Principal components
Principal components are calculated using one of the methods in pcaMethods (9) R package. The default method
is SVD with imputation which performs imputation and
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) iteratively until estimates of missing values converge. Nipals PCA will iteratively find components by leaving out missing values when
calculating inner products. Probabilistic PCA is also an iterative method that uses density model for calculating principal components.
Data pre-processing
Row scaling uses one of the methods from pcaMethods (9)
R package. Unit variance scaling method divides the values
by standard deviation so that each row has variance equal to
one. Pareto scaling method divides the values by the square
root of standard deviation. Vector scaling divides the values
by the Euclidean norm of the values (square root of sum of
squared values).
Heatmap
Heatmap is plotted using pheatmap R package (version
0.7.7). The source code of pheatmap package was slightly
modified to improve the layout and to add some features.
The package uses popular clustering distances and methods (13) implemented in dist and hclust functions in R. The

list of distances include correlation (defined additionally as
correlation subtracted from 1), Euclidean, maximum, Manhattan, Canberra and binary distance. Linkage methods include single, complete, average, McQuitty, median, centroid
and Ward linkage. When k-means clustering has been selected, the R function kmeans is used.
Public data sets and pathways
ClustVis includes multiple popular public data sets for testing purposes: NKI breast cancer data set (14,15), Wisconsin
diagnostic breast cancer data set (16) and Fisher’s Iris data
set (17).
In addition to small data sets, we used the last version
of Multi Experiment Matrix––MEM (18). MEM contains
a very large collection of public gene expression matrices
from ArrayExpress (5), together with annotation tracks
where available. Genetic pathways were downloaded from
g:Profiler web tool (12). From Gene Ontology, only biological processes were included. Microarray platforms and genetic pathways cover currently 17 species.
RESULTS
Overview of the user interface
ClustVis is aiming for an intuitive user interface. The tool
can be accessed by any modern browser (Google Chrome,
Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari). The user can
click on different tabs to move between the steps of analysis.
Results from visited tabs are automatically cached for fast
retrieval. Parameters are inserted by using widgets such as
drop-down menus, text boxes, sliders etc. On each step, reasonable default settings are given whenever it is appropriate
to save user’s time. When changing some of the settings, results are re-calculated and shown automatically.
Data input
Filtering and pre-processing. Both, PCA as well as
heatmap, take a numeric data matrix as input where multiple dimensions (e.g. genes) are measured in multiple observations (e.g. samples). Often, observations also have a priori
grouping defined by annotations that is useful to be shown
on the plot. For example, one may be interested in comparing diseased and normal samples marked differently. In this
case, one binary annotation track will be available.
To make data input easier for the end user, we have defined the input file format that includes both, annotations
as well as numeric data, in a single file. Such file can be easily manually created in a spreadsheet program (e.g. MS Excel). Observation names are listed in the first row, followed
by any number of annotations and a numeric matrix. The
first column is reserved for annotation labels and dimension
labels.
There are two ways of uploading own data: by uploading
a delimited file or copying and pasting the contents of the
file to ClustVis text box. In both cases, the delimiter and the
border between annotations and numeric data are detected
automatically from the data. In the rare cases when it does
not work correctly, it is possible to specify them manually.

Instead of loading own data, it is also easy to load a sample data set or choose a public gene expression microarray
data set. In order to search for more relevant public data
sets from the list, it is possible to set the minimum number
of annotation tracks. Data sets that have no annotations are
excluded by default.
Hybrid select/textbox is used to find a gene expression
data set, so that a user can make queries using one or more
keywords of interest and then choose from the list that contains them. It is possible to use data set title, ID and/or platform ID for querying data sets from one of the 17 species.
In order to limit the number of rows shown on heatmap,
the first option is to select one functional category to be included. The list contains KEGG (19) and Reactome (20)
pathways and GO (21) biological processes that can be
browsed using similar hybrid select/textbox as used for data
sets. Both, the names and IDs of the categories are provided.
Another option to limit the number of rows is to cluster the genes using k-means first (13). A user can specify
the number of clusters; cluster centers are shown on the
heatmap. If the cluster of interest has been detected, the user
can explore it further by specifying the cluster ID.
Public data sets often contain annotation tracks that are
not informative. For example, some property can be common for all samples in the data set and, therefore, appear
as constant. Some of the others can have different value for
each sample and as such are not defining any interesting
groups. Therefore, annotation tracks that have at least two
and not more than eight levels are shown by default. This
can be changed by a user. In order to make it easier for users
to set these thresholds, number of levels in each annotation
track of the original data set is also shown.
Sometimes, users may want to analyze subsets of observations without the need to filter them manually and upload the subset as a new data set. Some larger public data
sets may also contain subsets of interest. ClustVis has filtering option for these cases: the user can select one or more
annotation tracks and levels in them to apply filtering. Filtered table is shown to the user so that he/she can correct it
immediately if anything has gone wrong.
Next, it is possible to aggregate observations belonging
to the same annotation group by taking median or mean.
In this case, each group will be represented with just a single
point, making the plot visually better in some situations. On
the other hand, it is not possible to estimate the variability
inside the groups this way.
Dimensions can be optionally centered and scaled before
doing PCA and heatmap. This is highly recommended if
they have different units, otherwise dimensions with larger
units would get unreasonably higher impact and can give
misleading results.
Many real-world data sets are lacking some numeric values due to technical issues encountered during data collection. Originally, PCA requires the whole input matrix to
be filled and clustering of heatmap works also better for
complete matrices. Therefore, missing values need special
treatment. We use pcaMethods R package (9) that includes
methods to impute missing data or calculate principal components directly from incomplete data set. The latter way
can also be reversed to predict a complete data set which
can be used for heatmap.

cancer samples. Ellipses and shapes show clustering of the samples.

PCA output
PCA plot shows a scatterplot with axes corresponding to
the two different principal components. These do not have
to be the first two showing the largest variance. Sometimes,
first components are related with technical variation such as
batch effect (22). In this case, the user can look at other components that can be attributed to more informative sources
of variability.
By definition, direction of each single principal component is not uniquely determined. In other words, one can
mirror all points along one of the axes without changing
the meaning of the plot. In ClustVis, the direction is determined so that median of each component is non-negative.
A user can change the direction using a checkbox, possibly
to make the plot easier to compare with PCA plot created
with the help of some other tool.
The possibility to mark annotation groups with different
colors and/or shapes is an important feature. This makes
comparing groups with each other possible. The tool offers
an option to choose multiple annotation tracks to combine
them. Prediction ellipses can be drawn in order to get a better idea how much groups differ from each other (see Figure 1). The confidence level that determines the size of ellipses can also be changed. For example, a confidence level
of 0.95 defines the ellipses in the manner that approximately
95% of the new observations from that group would fall inside the ellipse.
There are multiple options available for changing the final layout and appearance of the plot. A user can change
axes’ labels, font size, plot width and ratio, point size, color
and shape, ellipse line width and type, as well as the legend
position. Optionally, one can also show sample IDs on plot
to find specific points and hide percentage of variance explained.
Heatmap output
Heatmap shows a data matrix where coloring gives an
overview of the numeric differences. In ClustVis, hierarchical clustering can be optionally applied to dimensions
and/or observations. Users can choose which clustering

method to use (if any). Linkage method is another parameter that affects the results and can be changed. Ordering of
the clustering tree can be configured and annotation tracks
can be placed at the top of the matrix to interpret them in
conjunction with the clustering tree (see Figure 2).
A good color scheme is an essential factor for correct interpretation of the heatmap. The user can choose between a
variety of diverging and sequential color schemes (11). Diverging palettes fix colors in both lower and higher end of
the data and in the middle; they are better suited for data
that range to both, negative as well as positive, directions
(e.g. difference from some reference). Sequential palettes fix
the lowest and the highest value; they are more appropriate
for non-negative data (e.g. percentage between 0 and 100).
There is also an option to reverse the scheme colors and set
the limits of color range manually.
Other options are related to the changes in the layout and
appearance, such as the font size of observations and dimensions (if shown); font size and precision of numbers in the
cells (if shown); cell border color; plot width and ratio and
whether annotation titles are shown.
Export of analysis results
Both PCA plot and heatmap can be downloaded using one
of the three formats (PDF, EPS or SVG). It is also possible
to download the initial data in case a public data set was
used that was not available to the user before. Intermediate
results, including processed data, PCA scores, PCA loadings and variance explained by the PCA components can
be downloaded as well.

Both PCA and heatmap show an example caption above
the plot that describes the data processing and visualization
using full sentences. This makes it more convenient to describe the plot in an article written by a user of ClustVis.
Due to the large number of settings available there is also
an option to save them and generate a link that loads presaved settings. Subsequently, the link can be sent to collaborators to show current findings or keep it to return to the
same data set later.
DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Both PCA and heatmap can be used to estimate whether
pre-defined groups form separate or overlapping clusters.
For example, let us look at a data set about stromal molecular signatures of breast and prostate cancer samples (23).
54675 genes are measured, we aggregate them into 30 clusters using k-means clustering. From the PCA plot, we can
see that breast and prostate cancer samples form separate
clusters (see Figure 1). Inside both groups, we cannot differentiate between normal and tumor samples, but we can
see that normal samples vary less than tumor samples. Similar conclusions, except about the variation, can be drawn
using annotations above the heatmap (see Figure 2). From
the heatmap, we can find two samples (GSM662767 and
GSM662773) that look different from other samples and
are worth further investigation.
When applying software packages to visualize PCA on
scatterplot, default options are often used so that x- and yaxis have different scale. This is generally not a good practice if the scales of first components are very different be-

W570 Nucleic Acids Research, 2015, Vol. 43, Web Server issue

cause the plot can be intuitively used for approximating
Euclidean distances between points. Using different scales,
units of one of the components are magnified in relation
to the other and it is very hard to compare distances. In
ClustVis, x- and y-axis are always forced to have the same
scale.
When interpreting the clustering of heatmap, it is important to pay attention to which objects are merged into
the clustering tree first and not to the exact order of rows
and/or columns. Any two branches can be swapped without changing the meaning of the tree. A user can change
branch re-ordering method to make the heatmap visually
more attractive.
There is an idea to make the tool more interactive. For example, we could have 3D PCA plot so that the user can see
three first principal components instead of two and rotate
the points. We could also add links or tooltips for each point
or heatmap cell which will contain information on each specific observation. Although these ideas look promising and
are worth considering in the next version of ClustVis, we
have concentrated first on enabling users to easily generate publication-quality plots, rather than providing fully dynamic interactive exploratory environment.
Currently ClustVis limits the input file size and does not
allow matrices of very high dimensionality to be visualized
on a heatmap. This is mainly due to the performance issues:
huge matrices take longer to upload and calculate clustering and, therefore, make the tool slower and inconvenient
to use. In addition to that huge heatmaps are usually not so
easily readable. These limits may be reconsidered in the next
versions of ClustVis.
