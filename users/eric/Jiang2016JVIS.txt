Abstract Cross-domain research topic mining can help users find relationships among related research
domains and obtain a quick overview of these domains. This study investigates the evolution of crossdomain topics of three interdisciplinary research domains and uses a visual analytic approach to determine
unique topics for each domain. This study also focuses on topic evolution over 10 years and on individual
topics of cross domains. A hierarchical topic model is adopted to extract topics of three different domains
and to correlate the extracted topics. A simple yet effective visualization interface is then designed, and
certain interaction operations are provided to help users more deeply understand the visualization development trend and the correlation among the three domains. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

1 Introduction
Different research domains possess different research areas, methods, and models. Papers published in top
journals of a research domain can reflect the developments and trends of the domain. These papers focus
on the hottest topics of their research domain and are considered as important references to researchers.
Some research domains have similar research topics with other domains, so the research findings in one
domain may affect on other research domains. For example, some disciplines integrated two or more
research domains, subsequently becoming a newly emerged branch of science. These research topics
always belong to a promising research area worth paying attention to. Hence, this study aims to find out
the trend of cross domain. The main objectives are as follows: (1) To use a text mining method to find out
the topics of each research domain and to create a hierarchical and evolutionary relationship among these
topics. (2) To use visualization tools to present the topics and the relationship among these topics, and to
provide interactive operations to help users find the cross-domain topics and understand the trend of crossdomain research.
Many works in science metrics have been published to show the development of a specific domain.
According to the research literature, they can be classified into several categories, such as: citation
analysis, co-cited analysis, coauthor analysis, co-word occurrence analysis, and word frequency analysis.
For nonexperts, these works provide entry points to a domain, and as means of gaining knowledge on

both macro and micro levels. For experts, these works provide validations of perceptions and are means
to quickly investigate trends and new information. However, only a few of these works consider the
cross-domain research topics and design an interactive visualization interface. In the visualization
domain, some works are about science research text topic mining, but few consider the hierarchy
structure of topics and do not aim at finding out the evolution of cross-domain topics. In the present
study, we do not focus on the text mining technique, instead, we use an existing algorithm to find out
the relationship of cross science domains. We use the topic probabilistic model to find and construct a
hierarchical structure of topics, analyze the evolution of topics, and design an interactive system for both
experts and nonexperts.
Each research domain can be represented by the top journals of the domain since the papers reflect the
latest status of the research domain and represent some new research directions. Our research domain is
visualization which is a rising science with developing prospects that few people can clearly explain the
exact position or the core technology of this domain. The top scholarly journal of visualization is IEEE
transactions on visualization and computer graphics (TVCG), in which articles about visualization and
computer graphics are published. The journal makes it more difficult to clarify the relationship between
these two research domains. So we aim to find out and analyze the relationship among visualization,
graphics, and data mining via a hierarchical topic model and design a visualization of evolution of the crossdomain knowledge.
The following sections explain the proposed method and visualization design (Fig. 1). The contributions
of this study are as follows: first, a hierarchical topic model is used to construct a hierarchical and network
structure of the cross-research domain topics; second, a visual design that enables users to interactively
explore topic mining results and determine the patterns is proposed.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work on scientific topic
finding, topic probabilistic model, and text visualization. Section 3 discusses a probabilistic topic modeling
method, and the construction of a network and hierarchical structure of topics. An evolution analysis of
topics is also performed. Section 4 details the proposed visualization design. Section 5 demonstrates the use
of the proposed visualization tools in three case studies. Finally, Sect. 6 shows the conclusions.

2 Related work
The following related works have been reviewed. These works can be classified into three areas: scientific
topic finding, topic probabilistic model, and text visualization. In this section, some related research works
that influence the present study are briefly introduced.
2.1 Scientific topic finding
In the scientometrics domain, many works exist about mapping knowledge domains. This domain is related
to our work since we aim to find research topics of a domain or find the cross-point of some research
domains. The main methods used in scientometrics include the following: citation analysis, co-citation
analysis, co-word analysis, coupling analysis, word frequency analysis, and so on. Typical works with
similar goals as those of the present study have been reviewed.
Chaomei Chen has performed excellent work on knowledge map not only through a mathematical
method to construct a co-citation relationship of studies but also through a great visualization design of the
co-citation network of a knowledge domain (Chen 2004, 2006). In his visualization design, certain indicators are proposed to present the turning points of a knowledge domain, such as landmarks, pivots, and
hubs. Ding compares three methods in scientometrics (Ding and Chen 2014), where the result shows that
hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), a generative probabilistic models, is more sensitive and reliable than
traditional co-word and co-citation methods. Hence, the present study adopts a topic probabilistic model to
detect and track topics. Boyack (2004) has generated the highest performing papers of PNAS for over a
20-year period via citation analysis. The papers describe changes and trends in the subjects that generate the
highest effect within this domain. Newman (2004) has also performed coauthorship analysis, during which
networks are constructed where nodes are scientists and two scientists are connected if the scientists have
coauthored a paper. Through this work, scientific collaboration patterns are found. Mane (Mane and Börner
2004) has demonstrated burst detection algorithm, co-word occurrence analysis, and graph layout techniques to generate maps that support the identification of major research topics and trends. This work has
determined burst words for 20 years and constructed a variation chart of ten typical words. Ginsparg et al.
(2004), Landauer et al. (2004) and (Griffiths and Steyvers 2004) have used texts from papers as data sources
and machine learning techniques to analyze, structure, and evolve academic literature. Romo-Fernández
et al. (2013) describes an analysis of keywords which was aimed at revealing publication patterns in the
field of renewable energy. The data and tasks in these works are similar with those in the present study,
which serve as motivations to use a general text mining process with research papers. However, most works
in this area provide insufficient interactive actions for users. The present work enables users to explore text
mining results by providing certain interactive visualization tools.
2.2 Topic probabilistic model
Topic modeling provides methods to automatically organize, understand, search, and summarize large electronic archives. Via topic modeling, hidden themes infused in a text collection can be found; documents can be
annotated based on themes; annotations can be used to organize, summarize, and search texts. Many topic
probabilistic models have been proposed in recent years in the fields of machine learning and data mining.
A traditional vector space model uses a vector to represent terms and documents and uses relationship
among vectors to correlate documents. However, a famous work called latent semantic analysis (Deerwester
et al. 1990) has mapped terms and documents to a latent semantic space. The model avoids certain ‘‘noise’’
in the vector space of original documents and makes information retrieval more accurate. This model is a
basic model on which many proposed topic probabilistic models are based.
Another widely used model is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is a model proposed by Blei et al.
(2003). LDA is a generative model, in which each topic is a distribution over words, each document is a
mixture of corpus-wide topics, and each word is drawn from one of these topics. This model uses posterior
expectations that can visualize a hidden thematic structure in large corpora. LDA is a simple topic model
used to find topics that describe a corpus; this model can be embedded in more complicated models, such as
the correlated topic model (Blei and Lafferty 2007), dynamic topic model (Blei and Lafferty 2006), labeled
topic model (Ramage et al. 2009) and hierarchical topic model (Mimno et al. 2007). The correlated topic
model uses a logistic normal on the topic proportions to find patterns in how topics tend to co-occur. The
dynamic topic model uses a logistic normal in a linear dynamic model to capture how topics change over

564

time. Blei has indicated that time-corrected similarity is based only on topic proportions because time is
factored out, given that topics associated to components differ every year.
Wang et al. (2013) proposed an algorithm to recursively construct a hierarchy of topics from a collection
of content-representative documents. The framework is called constructing a topical hierarchy (CATHY).
CATHY is employed in the present study to construct a hierarchical structure of topics, and this framework
is combined with a dynamic topic model to capture trends and changes of the topics. Moreover, rich
interactions are provided to allow users to analyze individual topics of interest.
2.3 Text visualization
Our work is related to research on text evolutionary visualization and multisource-data visualization and
some visualization work in scientometrics.
The most famous evolutionary visualization is based on the river metaphor, ThemeRiver (Havre et al.
2002). In this work, each layer represents a word. The river flows from left to right representing the change
of the word over time. We use a flow chart as a part of our visual analytic system. Many works are based on
ThemeRiver, using topics instead of words, and each layer represents a topic. TIARA was proposed to
combine word cloud and the stack graph to allow users to examine and analyze the topic content over time
(Wei et al. 2010). Recently, TextFlow was proposed, introducing a seamless integration of visualization and
topic mining techniques (Cui et al. 2011). In this work, the authors extracted three-level features: the topic
evolution trend, the critical event, and the keyword correlation, and they made a visualization design to
present the result. HierarchicalTopics integrated a hierarchical topic construct algorithm with ThemeRiver
view for the users to discover interesting patterns in large textual collections (Dou et al. 2013). StoryFlow
(Liu et al. 2013) used storyline to illustrate the dynamic relationships between entities in a story. ThemeDelta (Gad et al. 2015) applied sinuous, variable-width lines to show evolution of a text corpus on a
timeline. Wu et al. (2014) combined Sankey graph with a tailored density map to analyze the diffusion of
public opinions. Heimerl et al. (2015) featured an extended version of a streamgraph to depict clusters over
time to visualize scientific literature. These works presented many good designs to represent text. However,
the focus was not on cross-domain representation of topics.
Several works have focused on multisource-text data visualization. Dou et al. (2011) presented the
analysis and visualization method for computing the distinction of a scientific document collection. They
suggested a simple and intuitive visual design that enables users to explore the results. Oelke et al. (2014)
used a topic coin view to represent the topics of different research domain. A work use multisource-data
based on a widely used pairwise graph matching metrics, graph edit distance, and integrated multiple topic
graphs together to support analysis (Liu et al. 2014). ParallelTopics utilized the parallel coordinate metaphor
to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. These works focused on multisources
and not on evolution of topics (Dou et al. 2011).
Isenberg et al. (2014) described keywords, topic areas, and 10-year historic trends of visualization. The
authors used keywords to find the communication of different visualization groups and provide an understanding of emerging new research trends. However, this work was a presentation of results with no
provision for interactive user-operation. PNASLINK is a web-based literature-mapping system that can
display most frequently co-occur terms (White et al. 2004). Morris and Yen (2004) used a crossmapping
technique for visualizing multiple and overlapping relations among entity types in collections of journal
articles. As mentioned in Sect. 2.1, Chen (2006) conducted visualization work on knowledge mapping. They
provided a software, citespace2, for users to explore relationships and find important paper and new trends
of research domains. Similar to this work, the present paper integrated text mining with some interactive
visualization designs to identify the evolution of research topics in cross domain.
3 Data processing
3.1 Overview
Our work aimed to construct a visual analysis system that integrates computational methods with interactive
visualizations. The system contains five key processing stages: data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic
evolution constructing, topic mapping and visualizations. In Sect. 3 we focus on the first four, and in Sect. 4
we discuss visualizations.

The papers published in top journals reflect the research status of a research domain. Hence, we first
collected text data from SCI database including abstract, keywords, and title of papers in three journals of
different research domains. We then prepared the documents for topic models by lemmatizing and removing
stop words. The cleaned data then underwent the topic modeling stage, which extracted topics from the
document collection. The topic modeling we used is called CATHY, which is a hierarchical topic model.
Using this model, we obtained tree-structure research topics of each domain. We then constructed the
evolution relationship of topics. We constructed the relationship of topics mainly using similarities of
estimate topical frequency. A topic mapping method using MDS is discussed in the last part of this
section. After processing these data, we prepared a suitable data structure for visualizations. All these
procedures are automated. Thus, our method is easy to apply in other data sets.
3.2 Data and topic model
3.2.1 Data
We used paper data from SCI database. Given that we would like to discuss the relationship between
visualization, data mining and computer graphics, we chose the top journals of each research domain: IEEE
transactions on visualization and computer graphics (TVCG), IEEE transactions on knowledge and data
engineering (TKDE), and ACM Transaction on Graphics (TOG). We collected all the meta-data in SCI
website from 2005 to 2014. TVCG, TKDE, and TOG have 1739, 1469, and 1683 papers respectively. The
meta-data we downloaded from the website included the papers’ titles, authors, affiliations, keywords,
abstracts, the year of publication, and so on. Since the titles, keywords and abstracts are important parts and
are good representation of the topics found in the paper itself so they can be a good outline of each paper, we
used the paper’s title, keywords, and abstract for topic mining. We managed title, keywords, and abstract of
a paper into one document and marked the publishing year and the name of journal of each document. We
obtained more than 4000 documents, which included text information from 2005 to 2014 of three journal
papers. After we deleted the editor’s lead papers which had no keywords and abstract, we used the rest of the
papers’ information to do topic mining.
Before applying the topic modeling, we performed standard text preprocessing. We lemmatized all
words, added stop words, and removed the low-frequency words. Specifically, we removed all the words
that only appeared one time since we considered that such low-frequency words were not important and
insufficient to represent a topic. We believed that a word that strongly represents the point of view or reflect
the topic of a paper should be mentioned more than once in the title, keywords, and abstract. The stop words
we added included common stop words, such as functional words a, an, the, and then. Stop words also
included adverb, common nouns with no meaning in the papers and several verbs, such as make, define, find,
represent, guide, treat, and show. We also added method, algorithm, problem, framework, model, technique,
result, and study as stop words. These words are high-frequency words in the papers regardless of the
category of research domains. After preprocessing, we obtained a 14966-long vocabulary list of these three
journals.
3.2.2 Hierarchical topic modeling
As mentioned in Sect. 2, many probabilistic topic models used in text mining. In this subsection, we focus
on a hierarchical topic model that we used in our work. The model was proposed by Wang et al. (2013), and
the name of the framework is called CATHY.
CATHY constructs a hierarchy where each topic is represented by a ranked list of topical words, such
that a child topic is a subset of its parent topic. The researchers proposed an algorithm for recursively
constructing a hierarchy of topics from a collection of content-representative documents. The term cooccurrence network was used for topic analysis instead of the document-term topic modeling. In the
network, each node was represented by a word, and link between the nodes inferred that these two words
appeared in same document.
The steps of CATHY are as follows:
1. Construct the term co-occurrence network Go from the document collection where 0 refers to root. Set
topic t = 0.
2. Cluster Gt into subtopic subnetworks Gz ; z 2 C t , set C t include all the children of topic t. And estimate
subtopical frequency.

3. For each topic z 2 C t , extract candidate words based on estimated topical frequency.
4. For each topic z 2 C t , rank topical words based on topical frequency.
5. Recursively apply from (2) to (5) for each subtopic z 2 C t to construct the hierarchy.
Figure 2 presents the top-down recursively inference process of CATHY. Each triangle in the cooccurrence network represents a word. The links and number represent the co-occurrence times of two
words in one topic. Links would be partitioned into different subtopics and recursively apply them to
construct the hierarchy.
We set some parameters for the algorithm. We set the level number to 2, which means a two-level
(except root) tree-structure of topics can be obtained. Root means TVCG, TKDE, or TOG journals in a
specific year. For the topic number, we set 8 to the first level and 4 to the second level. For example, the
number all the papers published in TVCG in 2005 is 65. We managed title, keywords and abstract into 65
documents. Then we used these 65 documents as data source to run the algorithm. After algorithm processing, we finally get a topic mining results. A two-level tree hierarchy represented the topics. The root of
the tree was the TVCG of year 2005. The first level had eight topics that reflected the major research themes
of 2005. As for the second level, all the topics in the first level had four subtopics. Therefore, the second
level included 32 topics in total that showed more details of the research topics of 2005 in TVCG. We
repeated the algorithm for all three journals in all 10 years and finally obtained 30 tree-structure topic results
for evolution construct and analysis.
We used this model on each year’s documents and on all documents for 10 years as well. The topic
model constructed no relationship at the same level or the evolutionary relationship; we detailed the
construction of these two relationships in the next part.
3.3 Topic evolution construct
After the hierarchical topic model worked out, we obtained the tree-structure topic distribution for 10 years
of these three journals. The topic number is 8 for the first level, and 4 for the second level. The number is an
empirical value in our experiments. These topics have evolutionary relationship intrinsically, but we did not
get it in a mathematical method. So we need to construct the relationship by an evolutionary model.
In order to get the evolutionary relationships, we need to judge the similarities between each topic. After
some experiments, we choose the simple cosine similarity to measure topics’ similarity.
3.3.1 Find new topic
Similar to knowledge map, our work also intends to help users gain understanding of a research domain.
New topics in a research domain allow users obtain quick entry of their research in an unfamiliar domain.
Identifying new topics in the past can help users understand the development of the research domain and
summarize the rules and patterns for further research. We proposed a method to detect potential new topics
and further combined the results with interactive visualization designs that we presented in Sect. 4 to help
users find the real new topics.

For the first-level topics, we have all 240 topics from 2005 to 2014, so that is 24 topics each year. We
then computed the cosine similarity of topical frequency of each word in adjacent years and obtained 9
similarity matrixes. For example, year 2005 and 2006 both had 24 topics, we counted the similarities of all
the topics of 2005 and 2006 to obtain a 24 9 24 matrix M. Each row had the similarities of a topic of 2005
with all the topics of 2006. Each column had the similarities of a topic of 2006 with all the topics of 2005.
Mij represented the similarity of topic i of 2005 and topic j of 2006. The largest number of column
j expresses the biggest similarity that topic j of 2006 with topics of 2005. There is an intuitive understanding
that if the biggest number of column j remains small, then perhaps topic j(j = 1… column count = 24) of
2006 is a new topic because of its difference from all the topics of last year. Based on the intuitive
hypothesis, we use a simple method to judge whether a topic was a probable new topic.
We used a standard value to help determine a threshold for judging whether a topic is a new one or not.
We named the standard N, which is a percentile. N was made equal to the amount of the largest number of
column j that was greater than threshold and the amount of column number was divided. That is,
N = sum(biggest number of column j that is greater than threshold)/sum(the column count). (j from 1 to
column count).
For example, when we set N to 90 %, and the largest numbers of column j in 2005–2006 were.

The threshold can be set to 0.4 such that 22  90 % 9 24 = 21.4 numbers greater. The N can be set by
users; the greater the N has been set, the smaller the threshold becomes. Moreover, we used another fixed
threshold 0.4 to judge if a topic is a new topic because sometimes the threshold computed by N would be too
big, on this occasion, the topics are probably not new ones. Therefore, we used this fixed threshold as a filter.
3.3.2 Evolutionary relationship
After obtaining the hierarchical structure of topics, we needed to consider their evolutionary relationship. As
mentioned, we obtained 30 tree-structure topic results after running CATHY. The 30 results belonged to
three journals in 10 years. Each result of a year had 8 topics in the first level and 32 topics in the second
level. We considered only the first-level topics that inferred big trends of journal topics.
The topic evolution model based on CATHY is shown as Fig. 3.
Variable x is a Boolean variable, which indicates whether the topics of two adjacent years have correlations. If x equals 1, then there is a relationship between these two topics, vice versa. The value of x

Fig. 3 The topic evolution model


depends on the matrix Mt;t1 . Mt;t1 ¼ mij t;t1 is a matrix of Kt1  Kt ; where Kt1 indicate the total topic
number of year t - 1. mij is the correlation of topic i in t - 1 and topic j in t, if mij less than a threshold, then
the corresponding variable x is 0.
We used cosine similarity to judge the correlations of topics. We counted the similarity of topics by
computing all the probability of word distribution and the top ten feature probability word distribution. The
computation method is the same as we introduced in finding new topics. We assigned the number of the
topic to 24. Thus, we obtained two 24 9 24 matrixes M1 and M2 of all the words and feature words of two
adjacent years. For example, for year 2005–2006, m1ij inferred the similarity of all vector of topic i of words
of 2005 and topic j of 2006, and m2ij infers the similarity of feature vector of topic i of word of 2005 and
topic j of 2006.
We now provide two definitions: highly possible evolutionary relationship and potential evolutionary
relationship. Highly possible evolutionary relationship meant if these m1ij and m2ij were both greater than the
thresholds, we marked the topic i of 2005 and topic j of 2006 had highly possible evolutionary relationship.
The conception means that the two topics have an evolutionary relationship according to the text mining
results. As for potential evolutionary relationship, we cannot judge whether there is an evolutionary relationship between two topics according to the text mining results, but we found a most potential relationship
of a topic for users using the following method and let user judge it through visualization view.
Using these two similarities, we obtained the highly possible evolutionary relationship of 2 years.
However, many topics had no high similarity with any topic of the next year. Therefore, these topics would
seem like a ‘‘lonely island,’’ and we could not see any relationship with other topics. To avoid this problem,
we used another method to judge the potential evolutionary relationship between adjacent years.
Matrix M1 we obtained from the last procedure is 24 dimension 9 24 dimension. In a same example of
2005–2006, row i represents all the similarities of topic i of 2005 with all the topics of 2006 (i = 1…column
count = 24 in the first level). If all the numbers belonging to the row were smaller than the threshold, then
using the aforementioned method, the topic i does not have a relationship with the next year’s topics. On this
occasion, we find the maximum number of the row: m1ij (j = 1…24), and treat topic j of 2006 and topic i of
2005 as having a potential evolutionary relationship. This method may not be an exact method to construct
the evolutionary relationship, but is easy to understand and all procedures are produced automatically, which
do not require users’ instruction or operation. Moreover, as we will present the details in the next chapter,
we provide an interactive visualization interface to let users judge and analysis the relationships between the
topics.
3.3.3 Topic mapping
After CATHY ran, we obtained the topical frequency, which is a distribution over words. As mentioned
earlier, the vocabulary length is 14,966. Thus, we treat each topic as a 14,966-dimension vector and each
dimension is represented by the words’ probability in a latent sematic space. Then, we obtain the relative
position of each topic. We thus need to reduce dimension to present topics on a two-dimensional axis
system.
For the first topic level, all 240 topics occur over 10 years. We use the vectors that infer the 240 topics to
conduct topic mapping. We choose multidimensional scaling (MDS) to do dimensionality reduction. MDS
is an algorithm that can keep the information of vectors while mapping a high-dimensional space into two
dimensions. Thus, in a two-dimension axis system, the similar topics marked as nodes are placed close to
each other. By this algorithm, we can easily obtain the relative space information of topics, and we can gain
an intuitive understanding of the similar topics.
4 Visualization
We design views for representing the topic mining results and let users make their own analysis. Our design
is to fulfill the following tasks: (1) understanding the concept a topic represents; (2) understanding the time
evolution of the topics; (3) representing hierarchical structure of topics; (4) representing the similarities of
topics; (5) identifying new, disappeared, and cross topics; (6) identifying the relationship inside a research
domain and between some research domains. To achieve these goals, we design an interactive tool, which
includes five views that include word cloud, sankey diagram, scatterplot, treemap, and stream diagram to
present our visualization.

4.1 Word cloud
After CATHY process, topics are defined as distributions over words that have different probabilities to
occur within the specific topic. We wish to provide users more details of a specific topic and help them
obtain a deep underlying concept of each topic. Therefore, we use a simple word cloud to display a topic.
The word displayed in a word cloud is the most probable in the topic. The font size of each word represents
the occurrence probability of each word in this topic. Figure 4a shows that via the simple word cloud, users
can easily obtain the detailed concept of a topic represents. The bigger word cloud was the topic of the first
level, and four smaller word clouds were the topics of the second level, which were subtopics of the topic of
the first level.
4.2 Scatter plot
In Sect. 3, we mentioned that we obtained the relative space position relationship of each topic using MDS.
In visualization, we used a scatterplot to represent the space information of each topic. Because MDS is
quite stable, so the similar topics will stay close to each other. We map the topics’ process results into a 2Dcoordinate system as shown in Fig. 4b. The x-axis and y-axis have no meaning but to they present the
relative position of each topic. We marked the topics of these three journals with different colors: blue for
TVCG, orange for TKDE, and green for TOG. The opacity of each node infers the year of the topic. High
opacity denotes the topics that belong to recent years, and low opacity denotes the topics that belong to past
years.
It is easy to identify that TKDE is not close to other two journals. When a mouse is hovered over a node,
the most probable word of the topic appears as a title. Users can obtain the primary information of this topic.
When a node is clicked in this scatterplot, the respective topic word cloud and the subtopics word cloud
show at the same time. Therefore, users can obtain more details of this topic. The scatterplot achieves goal
(4), which represents similar topics and helps users judge the evolutionary relationship between topics.
4.3 Sankey diagram
We used Sankey diagram to represent the evolution of topics over 10 years. Sankey diagram is widely used
in text visualization. Compared with stream diagram, sankey diagram represents topics using separated
rectangles. We linked the similar topics of adjacent years to construct a changed flow of topics. The x-axis
represents the year from 2005 to 2014. Thus, there are ten columns show the topics. We marked the topics
from 1 to 192. Topic 1 to topic 24 denote the topics of 2005, topic 25 to topic 48 denote the topics of 2006,
and so on. The topics of three journals in a specific year show on the same column of Fig. 1. The node
marked with three different colors refer to three journals. The height of each node depends on the number of
documents that belong to the topic in a specific year.
In Sect. 3, we used a method to find new topics. In visualization, we used rectangles with no stroke to
represent the normal topics and rectangles with red-thick stroke to represent the new topics. This feature is
easy for users understand and reminds users to focus to these topics. Moreover, we constructed the evolutionary relationship of topics. We use two concepts to present different probabilities of evolutionary
relationships: highly possible evolutionary relationship and potential evolutionary relationship. We linked
highly possible ones with orange and potential ones with green. If a topic is linked with another topic with
green, then these two topics may not have a real evolutionary relationship. If this topic is not that similar as
other topics, then maybe this topic is a disappeared topic that has not been discussed in next years. Figure 1

Fig. 5 Sankey diagram shows the topics relationship in adjacent years. The curve links shows that has a relationship between
two topics. Purple curves denote relationships between cross topics, orange curves denote the highly possible evolutionary
relationships, and green curves denote the potential evolutionary relationships between topics

Fig. 6 Treemap of the second level the similarity threshold is 0.6 which means if the similarity of two topics are larger than
0.6, a blue curve links these topics to each other

indicates that most links are marked with orange, which means that potential relationships are not as strong
as highly possible ones. Users can mainly analyze the potential links to judge whether a topic is disappeared.
Figure 5 shows that a topic may be similar to one or more, or no topics at all. Topics from a journal may
be similar to those from other journals. In this occasion, we know that these three journals discussed
common topics, which may infer the cross-point of these different research domains. In the sankey diagram,
in addition to orange and green, other links are marked with purple. This color represents links of topics
from one journal to another. Users can check these purple links to examine and analyze those cross topics.
4.4 Treemap diagram
In addition to analyzing the evolutionary relationship of topics, our work has another main goal: identifying
the relationship inside a research domain and among some research domains. To achieve this goal, as we
mentioned in Sect. 3, we use documents from the entire 10 years and divide them based on journals for data
processing. Therefore, we obtained three tree-structure topic results as the hierarchical structures of topics
and the similarities of topics inside one journal and among three journals. Treemap is a common visualization design to represent the hierarchical structure. Considering that we obtained a hierarchical structure in
topic mining process, as well as our desire to link-related topics with curves, we choose treemap rather than
node-link graph.

Fig. 7 Bottom of the figure as a stream diagram with a scatterplot. The stream diagram shows the trends of topic
‘‘visualization,’’ and the marked scatterplot showing the similarities of topics related to topic ‘‘visualization’’

On the first level, we annotate the topics with an ID from 0.0 to 0.15, 1.0 to 1.15, and 2.0 to 2.15. The
first 0 denotes TVCG, 1 denotes TKDE and 2 denotes TOG. The number behind point from 0 to 15 denotes
the topic ID. On the second level, we annotate the topics similarly: 0.0.0 to 0.0.3, 0.1.0 to 0.1.3, and so on.
The last number is between 0 and 3, which denotes the subtopics’ ID.
As Fig. 6 shows, the different stroke colors of three larger rectangles shows these three journals: red for
TOG, green for TKDE, and orange for TVCG. In addition, the smaller rectangles with different colors show
the different topics of the first level. Moreover, the smallest rectangles show the topics of the second level,
which are the subtopics of the first-level topics. The text inside the rectangles is the most probable terms of
the topic to help users get the primary information of a topic.
Moreover, we construct all the similarities between topics and want to show them in the treemap
diagram. Thus, we use curves linking two topics to show that these two topics are similar to each other.
The curved lines over these rectangles represent the similarity among topics. If the similarity is larger
than the threshold, we link two topics with a curve line. The threshold of similarities can be changed by
users from 0.1 to 1 using the control bar under the treemap. The link shows the two topics have intrinsic
connections. We can easily find the connections between two journals as well as inside journals. Figure 6
shows that when users hovering the mouse over a rectangle, the word cloud of corresponding topic shows
the topic details. When users click a rectangle, the corresponding curve lines are highlighted with red for
users to see more clearly and then explore the detail of topics. The Treemap diagram is independent of other
view which shown in Fig. 1.
4.5 Stream diagram with similarities
Stream diagram is an effective visualization tool for representing the trends of a topic. For example, as
Fig. 7 shows, we picked the topics that have the term ‘‘visualization’’ in each year, and estimate the word
frequency, then mark in the stream diagram. The diagram shows that the visualization topic has become
more and more important in the journal TVCG, because the frequency is much higher in recent years than
that in 2005. At the bottom of the stream diagram, we use a scatterplot to show the similarity of other topics
with topic visualization. We use circles to mark the topic visualization and rectangles to represent other
topics. When a mouse is hovered over a circle or a rectangle node, the most probable word of the topic
appears as a title. The y-axis is the similarity which ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 and x-axis represents the year.
Similar to the sankey diagram, we used blue to represent TVCG, orange to represent TKDE, and green to
represent TOG. From the figure, we can find out that there is no green rectangle which means the topics of
TOG do not have high similarity with visualization. Most rectangles are blue, denoting that most topics are
related to visualization in TVCG. The Fewer rectangles are orange shows TKDE includes some related topic
with visualization. This view provides users with an instinctual effect of a user-appointed topic term, helping
users find the relationship in cross-domain.
5 Case study
In this chapter, we used three user studies to show the effect of our topic mining results with visualization
tools. The three studies are implemented in two main views: evolutionary-topic results view and all topics

572

X. Jiang, J. Zhang

Fig. 8 In the left figure red circles with black stroke in the scatterplot show the topic 182, 158, and 202, respectively. These
three circles are placed close to each other which mean they are similar with each other

results view. The first view helps users find the changes and trends over 10 years in these three journals and
also helps users find the time point and analyze the reasons for cross-topic emergence. The second view is
the overview of all topics in 10 years. Users can obtain more details of cross-domain topics. Therefore, we
used three user studies, including the new topic analysis, the evolutionary cross-topic analysis, and the all
cross-domain topics analysis.
5.1 New topic finding
As presented in Chapter 4, we used some highlighting design to let users check and analyze the topic mining
results of TVCG, TKDE, and TOG journals. Users can easily find the highlighted information in the
interface without extra work. In this occasion, we mark the new topic with a red stroke in sankey diagram so
users can find it easily. As listed in Chapter 3, new topics are found in the ten-year period, which can be
analyzed individually.
First we choose the topic 43: contour in 2006 of TOG. Upon clicking the topic, we find it concerns about
contour, curve, shape, distance, and so on. This topic links with topic 67: point with a green curve, which
indicates a potential evolutionary relationship between them. We then checked the position of these two
topics in the scatterplot and found that the distance of these two nodes was not very close. However, we
found another node representing topic 127 placed in the same position as node 43 in the scatter plot. We
then checked the word cloud of topic 127 and noticed that the topics were about mesh, access, map, and
hierarchy, which were dissimilar to topic 43. Therefore, we inferred that topic 43 appeared occasionally
when the topic mining algorithm was run. Then, we chose topic 48 of TVCG in 2007. This topic shares the
same term as topic 77 (color). Thus, a green link occurred between them. However, after analyzing the word
cloud further, we found that topic 77 was about medical visualization, although we could not identify an
appropriate domain for topic 48. The distance in the scatterplot of these two topics was not close, which also
meant that these two topics had no real evolutionary relationship between them. Repeating the same
procedure for topic 62, 103, 116, 155, and 197, we found that these new topics may not be the new ones,
disappearing quite quickly in the next year.
We concluded that the reasons are the following: the algorithm was limited because the topic mining
algorithm was running automatically. We could not change the parameter or add extra information to it. In
addition, the size of data was not big enough in each year to obtain good topic mining results. We had only
100? papers of a journal in 1 year, which do not support a good result of probability topic model.
As Fig. 8 shows, we found that topic 182 in year 2012 of TKDE was similar to topic 202 in 2013. These
topics were about text, topic, and sequence. However, topic 182 was also very similar to topic 158 in 2011,
which meant it may not be a real new topic. Topic 158 was about web, PageRank, among others, which had
an intrinsic relationship with text. Thus, topic 182 was marked as a new topic maybe because in this year,
text mining, and topic modeling were popular topics even though many related research works had already
started before 2012.

5.2 Evolutionary cross-domain analysis
We marked curves with purple to denote that two topics belong to different journals. Figure 1 indicates that
the amount of purple curves was not as many as color orange or green curves. It means that most evolutionary relationships between 2 years are from same journal. This is easy to understand because one journal
had its own research domain and popular topics. Some links were from TVCG to TOG, or TOG to TVCG,
which is normal because these two journals were both about computer graphics. We then found some lines
from TKDE to TVCG, and most topics are related to ‘‘data.’’ TKDE is a major journal of data mining, and
TVCG includes papers belonging to visualization analysis, which examines data.
Those cross topics are listed in Table 1 as follows:
We first focus on cross topics of TVCG and TKDE. From 2005 to 2012, only one or no link was found
between these 2 years. Such a result indicates that these two research domains are not sufficiently closely
related in these years. We check these topics individually, and find that ‘‘data’’ in TKDE is related to

574

X. Jiang, J. Zhang

Fig. 9 The topics of TVCG in scatterplot

‘‘volumetric data’’ in TVCG and the term ‘‘data set’’ in TVCG has almost the same meaning as the same
term in TOG. However, a sudden increase of link amount is observed from 2012 to 2013. An obvious reason
is that the papers of VAST were collected into TVCG in that year. VAST is the top conference of
visualization analysis, and it is much closer to data mining than to graphics, science visualization, and
information visualization. ‘‘Graph’’ and ‘‘network’’ are popular topics in these 2 years. ‘‘Flow’’ of TVCG in
2012, which refers to flow data, became a topic similar to the topics of TKDE. Such a result indicates that
certain works using the data processing methods in data mining domain solve the problems of visualization
domain.
Then we focus on the cross topics of TVCG and TOG, but we have not found the real cross-domain
topics because these two journals share a same research area: computer graphics. We have checked all these
topics and found that they all belong to computer graphics domain, as opposed to visualization domain.
5.3 Cross-domain topic analysis
We now use the treemap view to analyze the topic mining results of all 10 years. We first check the first
level, which includes 16 topics from each journal, 48 topics in total. We change the similarity threshold and
see the change of the curves. When similarity = 0.9, no curves occur in the treemap. When similarity = 0.8, curves are only present for one journal. When similarity = 0.7, cross topics begin to appear. We
checked topic 0.1: data, set of TVCG and topic 1.6: data, xml of TKDE. Then, we checked the subtopic of
topic 0.1 by the second level treemap of the same threshold. We found that the similarity only originated
from one subtopic, which was topic 0.1.0: data, molecular, biology, and so on. We can be sure that the topic
that discusses biology visualization belonged to science visualization. The result showed visualization
analysis and science visualization had similar topics with data mining domain. Other cross topics originated
from TVCG and TOG, and they were on computer graphics, which were not the real cross topics.
We further lowered the threshold to 0.6 and found that topic 0.0: scatterplot, space from TVCG was
similar to topic 1.15: analysis, selection. Following the same steps as before, we found that the subtopics of
these two topics were not similar to each other. After adjusting the threshold, topic 0.0.0: scatterplot was
similar to topic 1.15.3: analysis. Topic 1.15.3 mentioned visualization, which is thus a common cross-topic.
Topic 0.5: graph, layout of TVCG was quite similar to topic 1.11: graph, subgraph of TKDE. They both
discussed the graph and network, which were in the same research area as data mining and visualization.

A text visualization method for cross-domain research topic mining

575

Although further lowered the threshold of the first level, no more real cross-topic emerged among these
three research domains.
We manually annotated the labels in Fig. 9 according to the text mining results which show the Sankey
diagram. From Fig. 9, we can find that those topics cross TVCG and TOG are in the left side of the
scatterplot. Those topics are very similar with each other and all the topics belong to computer graphics. The
topics: scatterplot, graph, event, data, and visual are in the right side of the figure. Some of them are close to
the orange circles that represent TKDE, but we can see the topics of TVCG and TKDE is not that close to
each other, although they have some cross topics. And some topics in the center part of the scatterplot such
as vessel, medical which belong to the scivis topics are not very close to computer graphics.
We therefore found the relationship among these three journals. TVCG and TOG shared topics about
computer graphics, but not about visualization. TVCG and TKDE shared topics primarily on data that
belong to visualization analysis and data mining. Via these results, we could identify that visualization
developed to be an independent subject from computer graphics in these 10 years. Visualization shares the
same cross topics with data mining, but primarily in the area of visualization analysis.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we used a hierarchical topic model to extract topics from three different research domains and
to construct relationships among topics. Therefore, we designed a visualization interface and provided
interaction operations for users to gain a deep understanding of the visualization development trend, as well
as the correlation of three subjects. Via three user studies, we found new and cross topics for these three
domains, especially for visualization. Our method also has some limitations, since user cannot adjust
complex parameters of the topic model. Also for nonexpert user, parameters are not easy to appoint. We will
deal with these issues in future work. Our work can be considered a brief introduction of visualization from
past 10 years. We hope our work can help expand the understanding of visualization. In the future, this work
can also be extensively used in other research domains or other data sources.
