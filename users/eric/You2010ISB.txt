ABSTRACT
This paper proposes the iterative visual clustering (IVC) on
unstructured text sequences to form and evaluate keyword
clusters, based on which users can use visual analysis, domain
knowledge to discover knowledge in the text. The text sequence
data are broken down into a list representative keywords after
textual evaluation, and the keywords are then grouped to form
keyword clusters via an iterative stochastic process and are
visualized as distributions over the time lines. The visual
evaluation model provides shape evaluations as quantitative tools
and users’ interactions as qualitative tools to visually investigate
the trends, patterns represented by the keyword clusters’
distributions. The keyword clustering model, guided by the
feedback of visual evaluations, step-wisely enumerates newer
generations of keyword clusters and their patterns, therefore
narrows down the search space. Then the proposed IVC is applied
onto nursing narratives and is able to identify interesting keyword
clusters implying hidden knowledge regarding to the working
patterns and environment of registered nurses. The loop of
producing next generation of keyword clusters in IVC is driven
and controlled by users’ perception, domain knowledge and
interactions, and it is also guided by a stochastic search model. So
both semantic and distribution features enable IVC to have
significant applications as a text mining tool, on many other data
sets , such as biomedical literatures.

visual representations for the users to analyze the profile of the
problem, to translate users’ interactions as input and constraints
to the data mining flow and then to represent analysis results as
interpretable visual information.
Unstructured texts, such as real time narratives and daily notes,
are one of the major sources for data mining, because of its
abundance and easy access. However, Natural language parsing
(NLP) will be less effective on unstructured text as the language
structures are unreliable or non-existing. So it is critical to have
intuitive and interactive methods to navigate and explore
unstructured text data to perceive, analyze and discover potential
patterns, trends or other hidden information, in the vast quantities
of unstructured information. The problem is particularly important
for health care applications, as most clinical and patient care
records and narratives are unstructured text sequences. For
example, knowledge inferred from keyword clusters of nursing
narratives is the key to understand the nursing working
environment and tasks which can further help to redesign the
nurses’ assignments and to improve nurses’ daily performance.
The proposed iterative visual clustering (IVC) is motivated by the
need of integrating users’ inputs into the system learning loop,
and then uses visualization techniques to interface user
interactions and the system. In IVC, users’ judgments on
keywords clusters’ meaning and their pattern shapes, together
with a global distance function, plays the role of objective
functions. Both automatic and interactive evaluations are coded to
change the probability distributions in a stochastic search process,
which in turn produces the next generation of keywords clusters.
Yet the number of all possible combinations of keywords derived
from the text data is huge, so a brute force way to sample every
combination of keywords is infeasible. To properly address the
problems of searching keyword clusters, evaluating keyword
clusters and generating successor clusters, IVC is broken into
several steps and the diagram of our process is shown in Figure 1.
First we start with a list of representative keywords, each of them
being a single-word cluster and being visualized as a distribution.
Second, the automatic evaluation linearly ranks the thumbnails

the dispersion of the shapes of keyword clusters. Third,
interactive evaluation, working with automatic evaluation, filters
out unsatisfied keyword clusters, updates the feedback and
stochastically produces three sets of clusters including seeds for
growing, seeds for mating and seeds for mutation. Finally,
clusters in the aforementioned three sets evolve into a new
generation of cluster population accordingly. In the loop of IVC,
users domain knowledge and interactions play critical roles in
every step: they evaluate the shapes of the clusters, identify seeds
need to be grown and control the dispersion and size of keywords
clusters. We also apply our proposed iterative visual clustering
(IVC) method onto nursing narratives to discovery important
keyword clusters inferring the knowledge of working
environment.
In summary IVC have contributions in the following aspects:
1) IVC helps users detect interesting keyword clusters and
hidden knowledge in unstructured text by visualizing and
organizing a large number of keyword clusters and their
distribution patterns in an iterative searching process.
2) Users help IVC narrow down the search space by
evaluations that combine visualization, geometry
processing, and improve the search process by interactively
updating the probability of the stochastic search direction.
3) Applying IVC onto nursing narratives, meaningful
keywords clusters and their implied knowledge are
discovered, leading to understandings and possible redesign
of nurse working patterns and working environment.
In the following context, we first review previous work, then
describe the procedures of text pre-processing and introduce the
visualization of keyword clusters. After that, the visual evaluation
model for keyword cluster patterns is formalized and the users’
interactive evaluations are described, followed by the elaborations
of the stochastic model of generating new clusters. Then the
results of applying IVC onto nursing data are present and
discussed. Finally, we conclude the paper with additional remarks
and future work.

2.RELATED WORK

Over the past decades, there has been much research dedicating to
document visualization, and they usually present the overview
of document collections [3][5] which are then clustered by
unsupervised learning algorithms [13]. Other text and document
visualization systems [1][21] investigate the keyword clusters
and classes within the free-form running text by mapping text
mining results onto visual metaphors, among which are images
[11], concept map [2], Implicit Surface [18]. Some of the
visualization techniques used in health information data are
related to IVC as they visualize the text depending on Keywords
Distribution [6]. CareView [12], for example, visualizes
integrated trends of both quantitative and qualitative data in
clinical records and narratives. LifeLines [17]describes a
visualization environment which provides an overview of a series
of events such as personal histories, medical records, and court
records. ThemeRiver [9] uses the natural image of a flowing river
as a visual metaphor to illustrate changes of themes over time.
While these works certainly introduce ‘visual information’ to
understand the non-visual text, the visualization processes are
separated from the text mining and analysis step, and few users’
feedback are taken in to drive the evolving of the system.

To feedback users’ judgment on the ‘goodness’ of visual
representations, researchers in Computer Graphics have
developed methodologies, such as Design Gallery [14], to
explore the parameter space of transfer functions by visualizing
the most dispersed image populations. Users pick up the best
images by observing them hence simplify the trial-error process of
parameter tweaking. The visual system in [20] also visualizes the
patterns of a great many keywords and forms the clusters of
keywords purely based on the shapes of their patterns. However
neither the quantitative shape evaluations nor the cluster
generation process is formalized. We found that visual systems
which rely on users’ interactions, if without a formal data analysis
model and explicit objective functions, usually cannot improve
the search process in text mining. To bridge the gap between
users’ subjections and the automatic text analysis process, Guo [8]
searches for multivariate clusters in high dimensional data by
interactive feature selections accompanied with lowerdimensional projections and computational measurements; Cluster
Sculptor [16] interactively explores the hierarchical clustering
process of high dimensional data by designing visual
representations for various types of data characteristics. The
clustering processes in both of the work above are optimized by
minimizing distance-based objective functions. However, we
realized that users’ subjection can be an embedded ‘objective
function’ and some search strategies can be integrated with users’
interaction in exploring the feature spaces and searching for a
global maximum. For instance, Genetic Algorithm [9], which has
a wide range of machine learning and optimization applications
[7], is suitable here because of its iterative evaluations.

3.1Text Preprocessing

For text that lacks semantic structures, a keyword is the smallest
and most available information unit that can be visualized. After
the standard procedures of tokenization and stemming, the
unstructured text sequences are transformed into a set of
keywords. Stemming could also be done by looking up general
purpose external resources such as WordNet [15]. Note that
stopping words are also filtered out, and aliases are given a
consistent name.
Using the set of extracted keywords, the original texts are labeled
using only keywords from this vocabulary. And for each keyword
in the restricted vocabulary, there is one occurrence vector per
document by labeling the number of occurrences along each line
of the document. If the number of document is 𝐷𝐷, each keyword
has

a

of

occurrence

vectors

,

where

�𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 1 , 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 2 , ⋯ , 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 � , and 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is the length of document 𝑙𝑙.

3.2Clustering Operators

A keywords cluster is a set of keywords denoted by 𝐾𝐾 = {𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 }. We
define two types of clustering operators, 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 and 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾
throughout the paper. When keywords are merged with 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ,
they are presumably categorized into the same group to suggest a
potential semantic-level unit or a concept, so their occurrences in
the text data are all dealt with as the occurrences of this concept.

keywords together with regard to the corresponding document:
𝑂𝑂𝑘𝑘 𝑙𝑙 = 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾�𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 , 𝑂𝑂𝑗𝑗 𝑙𝑙 � = 𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 + 𝑂𝑂𝑗𝑗 𝑙𝑙 , 𝑙𝑙 = 1,2, … 𝐷𝐷

(3.2.1)

. The other type of clustering operator 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 usually suggests the
occurrences of a specific event or activity so it groups two

1,2, ⋯ , 𝐷𝐷
(3.2.2)

. In the iterative keywords clustering process, both of the operators
are used to merge keyword clusters and produce various shapes.

3.3Weighted Keywords Linked Graph

A keywords cluster can also be viewed as a subgraph of a regular
graph that has links between any pair of individual keywords, so
the keyword clustering on this graph is inherently a process that
searches for the next keyword to connect with a subgraph. We
quantify the links between the keywords with a regular
graph 𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = {𝑉𝑉, 𝐸𝐸, 𝑊𝑊}. 𝑉𝑉 is a one to one mapping from keywords
to vertices, where 𝑉𝑉(𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 which is simplified as {𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 }. 𝐸𝐸 is
the set of edges where ∀ 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 , 𝑣𝑣𝑗𝑗 ∈ V, �𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 , 𝑣𝑣𝑗𝑗 � ∈ E . 𝑊𝑊: 𝐸𝐸 → 𝑅𝑅
assigns weight to each edge, indicating the cost of connecting this
two keywords. A keyword cluster with keywords {𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 } also forms
a regular subgraph 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 , 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 = 𝐸𝐸�𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝 , 𝑣𝑣𝑞𝑞 �, ∀𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝 , 𝑣𝑣𝑞𝑞 ∈ 𝑉𝑉({𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 }).

4.VISUAL PATTERNS EVALUATIONS
4.1Visualization of Keyword Cluster Patterns

The occurrences vectors of keywords clusters provide two specific
perceptions for the observers. First, the number of occurrences of
a word often indicates the importance or weight of a given topic.
Second, the distribution keyword occurrences have over the
course of a dialogue often implies a pattern of activity this
keywords cluster represents over time. So before the development
of visual representation, a threshold 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 for keywords
occurrences overall data set is used to select keywords with
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
as only keywords with
occurrences ∑𝐷𝐷𝑙𝑙=1 ∑𝑗𝑗 =1 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑗𝑗 > 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
enough significance are considered. Then for each remained
keyword in each document, the general shape of keyword
occurrences 𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 over time is smoothed into a curve by a Gaussian
Filter.

However, one
keyword’s occurrence vectors of any two
documents 𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 0 and 𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 1 do not have one-to-one correspondence
as documents run different lengths, therefore normalizing
occurrence vectors of all documents using the lengths would
result in stretched curve shapes that can not reflect the true
accumulated distributions for this keyword. To alleviate this
problem, we use a fixed-length Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
to convert the each time-domain occurrence vector 𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 , 𝑙𝑙 =
1,2, ⋯ , 𝐷𝐷 into a fixed length frequency domain intensity
vector 𝑂𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 . Each 𝑂𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 is weighted inversely with its total
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙

occurrences∑𝐷𝐷
𝑙𝑙=1 ∑𝑗𝑗 =1 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑗𝑗 , and a weighted average intensities

of �𝑂𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 �

𝐷𝐷

{𝑙𝑙=1}

are transformed back to time-domain as the

accumulated time-domain pattern for this keyword. In figure 2
one keyword’s distributions of individual documents are colored
in pink and its accumulated time-domain distribution is colored in

purple. The area enclosed by the curve and axes could be filled
with color using any polygon-filling method to highlight the
patterns. The differing lengths of X-axes in pink pattern windows
are the exact lengths of the documents, whereas the length of Xaxes in the purple pattern window is the length of FFT
transformation. The Y-axes throughout all figures are intensities
that are normalized to the range between 0 and 1.

4.2Automatic Evaluation on Shapes of
Keywords Cluster Patterns

An iteration of keywords clustering can sample and produce a
great number of different keywords clusters patterns. In our
automatic evaluation model, a distance function as an ‘objective
function’ provides with a metric to measure the ‘goodness’ or
importance of the geometry of the patterns. Figure 3 shows the
main Graphics User Interface (GUI) for IVC on nursing data. The
distance function for automatic evaluation is discussed in this
section and the interactive evaluation is introduced in later
sections.
Users can customize an initial set of templates with interesting
shapes to start measuring the shape variations in the cluster
pattern population. Those templates are approximated by standard
probability distribution functions (PDF), such as 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
distributions, and the pool of templates are dynamic as templates
can be added to or removed from the templates during iterations.
The bottom row of figure 3 illustrates a few templates in the initial
step of evaluation. The X-axes of curves are the length of fixedlength DFT and Y-axes again are normalized intensities ranging
from 0 to 1. We define a global function to calculate the distance
between cluster patterns and the set of templates by comparing
their pattern curves. Denote the patterns space as 𝑃𝑃.At iteration j,
𝑗𝑗 𝑀𝑀

𝑗𝑗

templates are �𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 �{𝑙𝑙=1} , 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑃𝑃 and keywords clusters patterns
𝑗𝑗 𝑁𝑁

𝑗𝑗

are �𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 �{𝑙𝑙=1} , 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 ∈ 𝑃𝑃. The global distance function 𝐷𝐷: 𝑃𝑃 → 𝑅𝑅

is defined as:

(4.2.1)

The function RM provides a rough-scale match between the
geometries of two pattern curves. Algorithms of patterns matching
involving scaling, translation and optimization [19] are available,
but they are not used here because they lack the real-time
interactivity in our applications. So we propose RM as an
approximation to find the best matching between two patterns,
and leave the finer-scale matching to users’ interaction, because
users’ perception of shape similarities is usually invariant to

scaling and translations. Let 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 be values sampled from

Given 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷(𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷(𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙 ), the longest common sequence
(LCS) could be found using Dynamic Programming [4]. However,
in IVC only the general shapes of the patterns are preserved as
occurrences vectors are smoothed, so 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 are often relatively
short thus LCS could be found in constant time. Among all the
𝑗𝑗
𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙 found are the longest among all LCS, and the best matched
𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗
template 𝑇𝑇𝑙𝑙0 to 𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 is the one that has the minimum Euclidean

distance to 𝑘𝑘𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 . Figure 4 (a) (b) display six sets of examples
among the best match between cluster patterns in the top rows and
the templates in the bottom rows. The same filled color indicates
the match. The global distance function also sorts the current
generation of patterns in an ascended order to reflect the
dispersion among all patterns. A smaller distance value indicates
the shape of pattern is close to one of the templates, and a large
distance value indicates the shape of pattern is different than all
templates. Then the thumbnails of sorted patterns are visualized
by two fixed size sliding windows moving from two ends of the
sequence towards the middle at the same time. First two rows of
thumbnails in Figure 3 are two fixed-size sliding windows. In this
way, users have a better overview of the dispersion among the
pattern shapes of current population.

third type of interactive evaluation provides graphical operators
on the shape of patterns to help the users compare the geometry of
shapes and customize new patterns.
New patterns can be generated by merging more than one patterns
using either ‘union’ or ‘intersection’ operators. Note that these
operators only perform in a graphical level whereby ‘union’
preserves areas covered by all patterns and ‘intersection’ only
preserves areas that are overlapped among all patterns. Figure 5
shows examples of (a) overlapping of two patterns (b) merging

EVALUATIONS
5.1Interactive Evaluation on Cluster Patterns

We now consider interactive evaluation. Users’ opinions on which
interesting patterns and which meaningful keyword clusters can
also be ‘objective functions’. One type of interactive evaluation
on cluster patterns is re-matching the patterns and templates to
improve the rough-scale match by RM function, as human’s
perception is known for good at telling shape similarities. This
type of interaction re-positions the re-matched pattern in the
sorted pattern list based on its new distance, and the improved
match accuracy provides a better arrangement on patterns
dispersion which will produce better feedback to the next
iterations. Another type of interactive evaluation change the
templates set. As more dispersed pattern shapes are formed in the
search process, users can save a present interesting pattern from
current population into templates or remove one useless template
when they are navigating the population of patterns. In figure
4(b), three keyword patterns are added into templates so the
matched templates for some keyword cluster patterns changed
accordingly. The changes in the templates will trigger the global

5.2Interactive Evaluation on Keywords
Clusters

In interactive evaluations, users’ can identify keyword clusters
that are either meaningless or promising to grow as well.
Important keyword clusters are saved as seeds to feedback to the
next iteration and meaningless clusters are rejected and removed
from current population. Interesting keyword clusters can also be
investigated or merged with other clusters by interactively using
clustering operators 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 and 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 . Figure 5 (c) –(e)
demonstrate the effect of (d) merging two clusters using 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾
and (e) merging two clusters using 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾.

larger values on their links so that they are unlikely to appear
again.
For keyword clusters that are deliberately saved or rejected by
users’ interactive evaluation, their corresponding subgraphs are
updated using equation (6.1.1) by setting 𝑐𝑐 as a constant value
less than 1; the subgraphs of rejected keyword clusters are
updated using equation (6.1.1) by setting 𝑐𝑐 as a constant value
larger than 1.

6.2Population Control

After updates take effect, the unimportant patterns in current
sorted population are filtered out by setting up two quantile
threshold indices 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 and ℎ𝑖𝑖 in the rank list of patterns. Three
candidate sets, including seeds for growing, seeds for mating
and seeds for mutation, are also generated from sorted
population to produce new populations to reproduce and fill the
gap caused by filtered out clusters .

(a)

The number of clusters in each seeds set is determined in a way to
fix the size of population in each generation. The following
equation is used to circumscribe the parameters in population
control:
𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + ℎ𝑖𝑖 − 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 + 1 = 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 +

6.KEYWORDS CLUSTER GENERATION

After evaluations, some keyword clusters are deliberately saved or
rejected, and the resulted changes in ranking causes the
probability of keyword links graph of the current patterns
population to be updated. Then how a particular cluster can be
grown and which keyword clusters should be grown will be dealt
with in the following sections.

6.1Keyword Links Graph Update

Intuitively, the update on weighted keywords links graph is to
‘squeeze’ the important keyword clusters and ‘stretch’ the
unimportant ones based on their ranking after evaluations.
According to the definition of weighted keywords link graph 𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘
in section 4.2, for every cluster 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 = �𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 � in current population,
the weight of the subgraph of 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 is updated by updating every
edge in the subgraph as the following equation:
𝐸𝐸�𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝 , 𝑣𝑣𝑞𝑞 � = 𝐸𝐸�𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝 , 𝑣𝑣𝑞𝑞 � ∗ 𝑐𝑐, ∀𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝 , 𝑣𝑣𝑞𝑞 ∈ 𝑉𝑉 ��𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 ��

(6.1.1)

where 𝑐𝑐 is proportional to the ranking of this keyword cluster
among others. Since the importance of keyword cluster patterns
decreases from two ends towards the middle, 𝑐𝑐 can be calculated
as:
𝑖𝑖

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶

𝑐𝑐 = ��𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 �−𝑖𝑖+1

(6.1.2)

where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is the population size. After updating the keywords
links graph, any keywords in important clusters now have smaller
weights on their links, so that they are more likely to appear in the
further clusters, whereas keywords in unimportant clusters have

(6.2.1)

where 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is the number of rejected clusters, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is the low index
end of the quantile filter, ℎ𝑖𝑖 is the high filter threshold, 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the
number of clusters kept for growing or seeds for growing, 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is
the number of seeds for mating, and 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is the mutation
rate. Note that the number of saved clusters 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 and the number
of rejected clusters 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 are both interactively adjustable and also
in-directly changes other parameters in the equation.

6.3Seeds for Growing

Seeds for growing, kept by users, expand themselves in the next
iteration. We assume that the probability of one keyword being
selected is inversely proportionally to the weight of the link
between the keyword and the cluster. Intuitively, a ‘nearer’
neighboring keyword of the cluster is more likely selected as
compared to the ‘further’ ones. If the link between a specific
keyword node 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 to a keywords clusters 𝑉𝑉 ��𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 �� connects the
keyword and the center of 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 , the weight of the link between
one keyword node 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 and the keywords clusters 𝑉𝑉 ��𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 �� is
1

𝑗𝑗

each keyword node 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 are sorted in an ascend order , and the
probability of selecting a particular link is assigned as 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 =
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿−𝑖𝑖+1
using Roulette Wheel rank weighting [19], where 𝑖𝑖 is
∑𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑖𝑖

the ranking of the link among the others, 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 is the number of
links. A random number r is drawn from uniform distribution
between zero and one, the link i in the sorted link list with
𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖−1 < 𝑟𝑟 < 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 is selected, where 𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 =1 𝑝𝑝 . It is easy to
prove that 𝑝𝑝(𝑟𝑟 ≤ 𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 , 𝑟𝑟 > 𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖−1 ) ∝ 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 when 𝑟𝑟 has a uniform
distribution.

Once a seed is grown, the occurrence vectors of keyword clusters
are also updated according to equation (4.2.1). The weight of
subgraph 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 of the keywords clusters also is increased by adding
more edges into the subgraph. Every cluster in the seeds for
growing keeps growing until the total weight of the subgraph
exceeds the weight threshold of current iteration. So a better
cluster whose subgraph was ‘squeezed’ previously will grow

faster and an unsatisfying cluster whose subgraph was ‘stretched’
will grow slower.

6.4Seeds for Mating

The keyword clusters in seeds for mating are also selected by
Roulette Wheel weight ranking, where the probability of each
keyword cluster being selected is proportional to their rank in
current population sorted by visual evaluation. Mating are
expected to introduce newer shapes, so patterns at both end of
current sorted population have higher probability of being selected
into the mating group. Thus the sorted population is divided into
two ranges
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
�1, � ��and �� � + 1, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶� , where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is the number of current

population. Each keyword cluster in two divisions is assigned a
probability 𝑝𝑝(𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 ) of being selected by the following equation:

Then seeds for mating are evenly sampled in two separated passes
running on the two intervals, and the keyword clusters from two
runs are paired and merged using 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 clustering operator in the
order from top to the bottom. The weight of the newly generated
keywords clusters and the occurrence vectors of keyword clusters
are updated accordingly.

6.5Seeds for Mutation

Seeds for mutation are randomly sampled, unique keyword
clusters from the new clusters generated by seeds for growing and
seeds for mating with mutation rate 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 . The mutated
keyword cluster is resulted from flipping any 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 clustering
operators into 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾, which represents the co-occurrences among
all keywords in this cluster. The weight of keywords clusters
𝐷𝐷
remains the same while the occurrence vectors �𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑙𝑙 �
of the
𝑙𝑙=1
mutated cluster is updated according to equation (3.2.1) and
(3.2.2).
To this end a new generation of keywords clusters is formed, they
are visualized and evaluated again.

7.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
7.1The Nursing Data Application

A procedure for manual recording of direct observations of
Registered Nurses (RN) work was developed to help working
nurses and nursing domain experts to investigate and understand
the numerous activities RNs engaged in to manage the
environment and patients flow. Observation data was recorded
on legal pads, line by line, using an abbreviated shorthand method
as unstructured text. A segment of a sample session of nursing
narratives is shown below:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Walks to Pt #1 Room
Gives meds to Pt #1
Reviews what Pt #1 receiving and why
Assesses how Pt#1 ate breakfast
Teaches Pt#1 to pump calves while in bed
Explains to Pt#1 fdngs- resp wheezes
Reinforces use of IS Pt#1

•
•

Positions pillow for use in coughing Pt#1
…………………

What to the outside casual observer appears to be single task
elements becomes a much more complicated array of overlapping
functions with inter-related patterns and trends. There are two
basic anticipated applications to analyzing RN work: (1)
identification of work patterns related to non-clinical work or
basic nursing work (2) staffing and assignment implications based
on work patterns across time. We applied IVC to 13 data sessions
of nursing narrative texts. After preprocessing the text with
procedures described before, 104 keywords, about 20 percent of
all keywords, are resulted and each keyword is represented by 13
vectors corresponding to each session. Different sessions have
differing running lengths and are neither synchronized nor
aligned. Therefore we used the accumulated time-domain
distributions previously introduced to rule out the synchronization
problem.

7.2Results of Keyword Clusters

During the iterations, various shapes other than templates are
introduced and two general types of keyword clusters can be
derived to demonstrate higher level knowledge, regarding to the
nursing working pattern and environment. The first type is the
general behavior patterns of nurses that can be implied keyword
clustered using 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾. Figure 7 (a)-(c) are three examples of this
cluster type, and a small colored square on the right top classifies
the sources of a pattern: surviving the evaluation (red), from one
seed growing (blue) and from seeds mating (green). The keywords
cluster on the right of (a) is represented by the curve on the left.
‘monitor’, ‘bed’ and ‘ekg’ are all equipments in patients’ room,
implying nurses are staying in ekg rooms and operating on the
equipments in a timely way the pattern of the curve indicates.
With one big peak and a much smaller peak sitting at two ends of
the time line, nurses may have ‘rushing hours’ in operating
equipments in patients’ room, both at the beginning and the end of
the day. As the first peak is much larger than the second, it may
indicate the need for operations decreased severely or operating
on equipments in patient’s room are usually arranged in early
hours of the working session. Given the span of two peak areas
are nearly the same, those jobs may be routine so that nurses can
finish them in a fixed period. Figure 7(b) indicates the working
pattern of nurses’ clearing up equipments and (c) shows the
working pattern of a group of actions including writing
documents, walking among places or listening to patients’ wants
The second type of concept is an event pattern or assignment
pattern represented by co-occurrences among keywords. A small
cyan square on the right up indicates that this group of keywords
is from mutation and has clustering operators 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 merge them
together. In figure 7 (d), the appearances of peaks on the left in
fact represent the co-occurrences of the keywords meaning that
nurses listening to the patients describe their syndromes and so
on. A large hump sits in the middle of the time line indicating it is
mostly in the middle of the working session that the nurses get
patients’ own descriptions about their situations. This working
pattern may either response to the shuffle-in of patients during the
middle of the working session, or show nurses are scheduled to
answer questions to patients in bed; the pattern in figure 7(e)
indicates the nurses’ activity of checking brain sheets for orders;
the pattern in figure7 (f) has zero intensity everywhere thus
demonstrates that nurses do not access linen room, carts and brain
sheets at the same time.

Figure 8. Keyword clusters that represent complex working patterns

Overlaying patterns together and coloring them with transparency
can also obtain insights of nursing tasks as shown in figure 8(a). A
specific assignment of ‘answer’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘check’, which represents
answering questions and regular checking for patients, has the
first peak in pattern almost coincided the first peak in the pattern
of the assignment of ‘review’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘order’ (reviewing orders). If
the two assignments usually happen in different places around
nursing working environment, then there might be a schedule
conflict or at least an inefficient arrangement in nursing tasks. To
further investigate interleaving behavior patterns or nursing
events, more complicated keyword clusters can be interactively
constructed using cluster operators 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 and 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾. Figure 8(b)
shows the example of merging results of two patterns in figure 8
(a) as (‘answer’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘check’) 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘review’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘order’.
Therefore the unified pattern of two event patterns, if considered
as a general behavior pattern, is generated using interactive cluster
operators. Similarly, pattern ( ‘pull’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘bp/temp’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾
‘request’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘listen’) and pattern ‘plan’ overlapping in
figure 8(c) have the pattern of figure 8 (d) if they are considered
as two necessary parts of one event pattern and merged by

(d)

‘plan’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾

(‘pull’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ‘bp/tmp’ 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾
‘request’)

cluster operator 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 . Sophisticated concepts therefore have a
explorations, and would be helpful in improving the design of the
working environment

8.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The iterative visual clustering (IVC) we proposed in this paper
aims to find semantically meaningful keyword clusters and their
patterns over time line from unstructured text data by searching
the possible combinations of keyword clusters, and supporting
visual and interactive evaluations and interpretations. Compared
to conventional text mining methods, our IVC does not define any
explicit objective functions but is driven by users’ intentions in a
stochastic search process to narrows down the search space of the
huge number of keywords cluster combinations. Users’ intentions
are feedback by interactions which both inject users’ domain
knowledge and direct the search process.
We will further refine the stochastic model of IVC and enhance
the visualizations and interactivity of IVC. To thoroughly explore
the inherent knowledge rooted in nursing narratives, we are now
expecting larger data sets. Meanwhile, IVC is applied to other free

running text corpus, such as biomedical literatures, to test their
