Abstract  The efficiency of long-distance acoustic signalling of insects in their natural habitat is constrained in
several ways. Acoustic signals are not only subjected to
changes imposed by the physical structure of the habitat
such as attenuation and degradation but also to masking
interference from co-occurring signals of other acoustically communicating species. Masking interference is
likely to be a ubiquitous problem in multi-species assemblages, but successful communication in natural environments under noisy conditions suggests powerful strategies
to deal with the detection and recognition of relevant signals. In this review we present recent work on the role of
the habitat as a driving force in shaping insect signal structures. In the context of acoustic masking interference, we
discuss the ecological niche concept and examine the role
of acoustic resource partitioning in the temporal, spatial
and spectral domains as sender strategies to counter masking. We then examine the efficacy of different receiver
strategies: physiological mechanisms such as frequency
tuning, spatial release from masking and gain control as
useful strategies to counteract acoustic masking. We also
review recent work on the effects of anthropogenic noise
on insect acoustic communication and the importance of
insect sounds as indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem
health.

Introduction
Insects were probably the first terrestrial animals to use
air-borne sound signals for long-distance communication
(Senter 2008): fossils of crickets and katydids from as far
back as the Triassic and Jurassic periods reveal sophisticated stridulatory structures for song production (Béthoux
and Nel 2002; Gorochov and Rasnitsyn 2002). Song reconstruction of a 165 my. old Jurassic fossil, Arachoboilus
musicus, (Gu et al. 2012) suggests that the ancestral condition for sound production in orthopteran insects was
a resonant mechanism, similar to the one in true crickets
(Gryllidae). Orthopterans have thus been producing sounds
probably very similar to present-day signals for at least
250 million years (Senter 2008). Much less is known about
the evolutionary history of sound production in the other
group of conspicuous sound-producing insects, the cicadas
(Hemiptera: Cicadidae), but earliest fossil records are from
the Upper Cretaceous (Senter 2008). By the end of the
Cretaceous, the familiar soundscapes of chirping crickets
and katydids, buzzing cicadas and calling frogs were well
established (Senter 2008).
Most insect groups that produce sound signals in a sustained fashion (crickets, katydids and grasshoppers in the
Orthoptera, cicadas in the Hemiptera and arctiid moths
among the Lepidoptera) do so in the context of mate attraction: typically males calling to attract females of their species (Gerhardt and Huber 2002; Greenfield 2014). The diversity of long-distance acoustic signals produced by modern
insects, spanning a frequency range from as low as 600 Hz

13

(the Malaysian katydid, Tympanophyllum arcufolium: Heller
1995) up to 130 kHz produced by some katydid and moth
species (Montealegre et al. 2006; Greenfield 2014), is enormous. These signals have been shaped over evolutionary
time by a combination of different selection pressures, physical and physiological constraints, phylogenetic history, costs
imposed by eavesdropping predators and parasitoids, sexual
selection and the biotic and abiotic environment in which
signalling occurs (Endler 1993; Ryan 1990). Dissecting the
effects of these different selective pressures is challenging
but necessary to understand how and why signals, signallers
and receivers are structured the way they are in the acoustic
assemblages that we see around us today.
Crickets, katydids and cicadas are the best-studied
groups among acoustically signalling insects, wherein a
number of species have been investigated for the physiology of sound production and reception, auditory processing and behaviour (Gerhardt and Huber 2002; Hedwig
2014; Stumpner and Nowotny 2014; Fonseca 2014). The
ecological context in which signalling occurs, however, has
received relatively less attention and will be the focus of
this article. We do not attempt a comprehensive review of
all the factors that may affect signals and signalling, such
as parasitoids and predation, which are covered in depth
elsewhere (Lakes-Harlan and Lehmann this issue; Hedwig
and Robert 2014; Conner 2014) or of all insect groups (lepidopteran communication is covered in depth in a recent
review: Greenfield 2014) but focus on recent work on the
role of habitat and co-existing signallers in shaping insect
signal structures, signaller behaviour and receiver physiology (see Römer 2013, for a more comprehensive and general review of insect acoustic communication and noise).

Insect acoustic signals and habitat
The natural habitat in which insects call can have significant effects on their signals and communication systems.
Acoustic signals are put out in the public medium of the
habitat through which they have to traverse before reaching
the ‘intended’ receivers (Wiley and Richards 1982; Bradbury and Vehrencamp 2011). The medium can affect acoustic signals in different ways. Signals are attenuated due to
spreading loss whereas reflection and scattering of sound
by the ground and vegetation can lead to temporal pattern
distortion and frequency filtering of the signal (Römer and
Lewald 1992; Römer 1998) thus compromising detection
and recognition by receivers. Over evolutionary time, signal structures of different species may, therefore, evolve to
be adaptive to the habitats in which they call, minimising
the effects of attenuation and signal distortion and, therefore, maximising transmission (acoustic adaptation hypothesis: Morton 1975).

13

J Comp Physiol A (2015) 201:133–142

Most studies examining acoustic adaptation of signals
have been carried out on vertebrates (reviewed in Ey and
Fischer 2009). There are very few studies that have examined acoustic adaptation in insects. A notable exception is
the study by Couldridge and van Staaden (2004) on bladder
grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Pneumoridae) in South Africa:
the transmission of calls of seven pneumorid species were
examined in four habitats (forests, savanna, fynbos and
karoo). The results provided some support for acoustic
adaptation at the macrohabitat level, since calls of forest
and fynbos species tended to show less distortion and attenuation in their native habitats. This was not, however, the
case for the calls of species in the other two biomes whose
signals transmitted better in non-native habitats.
The habitat may also affect caller behaviour: senders
of long-distance signals may be expected to select calling sites that maximise high-fidelity transmission (Endler 1993). Since the typical broadcast areas of most insect
sounds are in the range of tens of metres (Paul and Walker
1979; Römer 1993; Jain and Balakrishnan 2012), calling
site selection is perhaps more relevant to be examined at
small spatial scales (i.e. microhabitats) rather than at macrohabitat or landscape levels (Jain and Balakrishnan 2011).
Microhabitat selection in relation to calling sites was tested
for two cicada species but this study did not find evidence
that this was driven by call transmission (Sueur and Aubin
2003).
A number of studies have examined and found vertical
stratification of species in different calling insect assemblages (Nischk and Otte 2000; Diwakar and Balakrishnan
2007a, b; Sueur 2002; Schmidt et al. 2013). Whether such
vertical stratification is driven by acoustic adaptation has
been tested in the cricket and katydid assemblage in the
rain forests of Kudremukh National Park (KNP) in the
Western Ghats of Southern India (Jain and Balakrishnan
2012). For a wide range of signal structures, the ground
always emerged as the worst layer for acoustic signal
propagation, illustrating that microhabitat selection by species calling from the ground is obviously driven by factors
other than maximising signal transmission (Jain and Balakrishnan 2011, 2012). It is well known that calling from
greater heights increases broadcast area and transmission
distance (Marten and Marler 1977; Paul and Walker 1979;
Römer 1993; Ellinger and Hödl 2003). The understorey
(0.5–8 m) and canopy (>8 m) of tropical evergreen forests
are (similar) microhabitats which differ largely in foliage density as a function of height (Jain et al. 2010; Jain
and Balakrishnan 2011). In transmission experiments, the
mid-understorey (2–4 m) of the forest emerges as the best
layer for signal transmission for a variety of signal structures, with minimum attenuation and distortion of signals
(Marten and Marler 1977; Ellinger and Hödl 2003; Jain
and Balakrishnan 2012), probably because it offers the

J Comp Physiol A (2015) 201:133–142	

dual advantage of height above the ground and low foliage density. In spite of this advantage, only a fraction of
species in an assemblage are found to call from the midunderstorey (Diwakar and Balakrishnan 2007a, b; Jain and
Balakrishnan 2011) because it may offer less protection
from predators. This could also explain why several species
either call from within burrows or leaf litter on the ground
or from the dense canopy even though sound propagation
may be unfavourable. In summary, the only study testing
acoustic adaptation as an explanation of vertical stratification of calling insect species in an assemblage did not
find overall support for habitat acoustics as a major driver
of calling assemblage structure. One should note, however, that there may be individual species for which maximising transmission range or signal fidelity may act as a
major selection pressure: for example, Brochopeplus sp. (a
false leaf katydid calling from the understorey) upheld all
the predictions of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis in the
KNP assemblage (Jain and Balakrishnan 2012).

Acoustic masking interference
Another important problem faced by acoustically communicating insects in natural environments is the possibility of
acoustic masking interference. This is exemplified by the
noisy dusk choruses consisting of several species of acoustically signalling insects, primarily crickets, katydids and
cicadas calling at the same time and place. The fact that
different species do manage to communicate successfully
in these noisy conditions suggests that they have strategies
to deal with the detection and recognition of relevant signals in the presence of high levels of masking noise (Römer
2013). These strategies include changes in signal structure
over evolutionary time, signaller behaviour and/or receiver
physiology (Endler 1992; Römer 2013). A useful framework to examine strategies involving senders is the ecological niche concept.
Sender strategies: the niche concept
In community ecology, it is an unarguable fact that available resources such as space, food and time need to be used
in different ways to allow coexistence of ecologically similar species (Pianka 1973; Schoener 1974). Resource partitioning is believed to play a key role in establishing and
maintaining such coexistence (MacArthur 1958; Connell
1961; Schoener 1968). For acoustically communicating
species, the transmission channel for airborne sound signals can also be regarded as an ecological resource. With an
increasing number of sound sources at the same time and
place, the probability of interference and masking of overlapping sound signals is increased, impairing the detection

135

or discrimination of signals and resulting in acoustic competition (Bailey and Morris 1986). Acoustic competition
due to masking interference is expected to promote partitioning of the transmission channel among species in multidimensional space, consisting of the acoustic space of a
signal (its spectral and temporal features), as well as when
(time) and where (place) to signal.
Temporal partitioning
Hypothetically, coexisting species can partition their calling in time to avoid overlap and thereby acoustic masking
interference. Such temporal partitioning could occur at different scales: at the broadest scale, species with similar signals could breed in different seasons or several weeks apart.
This has not been investigated in a rigorous and quantitative manner in signalling insect assemblages. However, of
the 20 species constituting the acoustic insect assemblage
of the evergreen rainforests of KNP, 14 were found to overlap in their breeding season (November to March) and
could be found calling together in the same patch of forest (Diwakar and Balakrishnan 2007a). Temporal partitioning of calling species might instead be achieved on a diel
(circadian) scale. The trend that emerges from community
studies in rain forests in India (Diwakar and Balakrishnan
2007a), Panama (Schmidt et al. 2013) and Borneo (Grant
2014) does not support diel partitioning between calling
species of crickets and katydids.
In KNP, cicadas were found to be largely diurnal and
were almost completely partitioned in their calling time
from crickets and katydids, with little overlap even at dusk
(Diwakar and Balakrishnan 2007a). Similarly, a semiquantitative study on a dusk chorus of frogs, crickets and
cicadas in Malaysia indicates fairly tight calling windows,
though with some overlap, among different species (Gogala
and Riede 1995). Since these were not, however, analysed at species level, it is difficult to interpret the degree
of temporal partitioning. On the other hand, studies on a
cicada community in the neotropical rainforests of Mexico
revealed that seven out of nine species showed extensive
and overlapping calling activity at dawn and dusk (Sueur
2002). This general lack of diel partitioning and extensive
overlap in calling periods, especially at dusk, is interesting
and begs the question why. It is possible that the benefits of
signalling at dusk, which may include optimal atmospheric
conditions for sound transmission (van Staaden and Römer
1997), are high relative to the costs of signalling in other
time windows.
How then is intraspecific communication achieved in the
noisy environment of a dusk chorus? Temporal partitioning may be occurring at finer temporal scales, over minutes
or seconds, with one species calling in the silent inter-bout
intervals of the other. In addition, the fact that the calls of

13

	
136

many species are often discontinuous chirps may mean that
actual overlap between calls may be low even if two species are calling together. Both of these possibilities were
investigated in the KNP assemblage of crickets and katydids (Jain et al. 2014) by examining overlaps in calling
probabilities between pairs of species in 5-min windows
during peak calling time (gross temporal overlap or GTO)
as well as probability of overlap due to chance (in simultaneously calling heterospecific individuals) based on signal
temporal structures alone (fine temporal overlap or FTO).
There were significant negative correlations between the
distributions of GTO and FTO of the assemblage, suggesting that species pairs that had high overlap due to signal
temporal structure may avoid calling together (Jain et al.
2014). This assemblage-level signature of fine temporal
partitioning, however, needs to be validated by identifying
and testing the relevant species pairs in behavioural experiments to check for active avoidance of overlap in time.
Spatial partitioning
One of the most straightforward ways for different species
to avoid acoustic interference is to space themselves apart,
making use of the fact that sounds attenuate as they move
away from the source. Calling insect species could move
apart in both horizontal and vertical space: whereas the
former may offer more possibilities, being limited only by
available habitat or microhabitat, the latter will of necessity be constrained by the canopy height. There have been
very few studies relating calling activity to spatial distributions of callers of different species. In the cricket assemblage of Barro Colorado Island (BCI; Panama) horizontal
spatial distribution of callers on a relatively large scale,
where sampling sites examined were spaced 100 m apart,
appeared to be randomly structured with no support for
spatial partitioning at the community level (Schmidt et al.
2013). In the KNP assemblage of crickets and katydids, the
fine spatial structure of individual multispecies choruses in
the understorey was examined, with no evidence for active
spacing as a mechanism to reduce interspecific acoustic
interference (Jain et al. 2014).
On the other hand, vertical stratification of different
calling insect species is well documented, particularly in
rain forest communities of both the neotropics and paleotropics (Nischk and Otte 2000; Sueur 2002; Diwakar and
Balakrishnan 2007b; Schmidt et al. 2013). Demonstrating
vertical stratification is, however, only the first step, since
species in different strata are not necessarily acoustically
isolated from each other. Whether vertical stratification
serves as a mechanism to reduce acoustic interference thus
remains unclear. The use of space by signalling insects and
the acoustic context and structuring of choruses in natural
environments is clearly an underexplored area, with many

13

J Comp Physiol A (2015) 201:133–142

implications for intraspecific communication, signal evolution and acoustic biodiversity monitoring (Balakrishnan
et al. 2013, in press).
Spectral partitioning
The acoustic niche hypothesis indicates that different species in an assemblage should partition the available spectral space of sound signals among themselves (Krause
1987; Pijanowski et al. 2011). By inspecting spectrograms
of sound recordings, particularly those obtained in tropical
rainforests with high acoustic diversity, this appears as an
intriguing idea because distinct frequency bands can often
easily be assigned to advertisement calls of frogs, crickets, cicadas and katydids (Krause 1987; Riede 1993; Sueur
2002; Diwakar et al. 2007). However, the question arises
how well separated the acoustic signals of an assemblage
are in spectral space and whether these can be thought of
as unique frequency niches. For insect taxa such as grasshoppers, many katydids and cicadas, with their broadband
advertisement signals in the range of up to several kilohertz, frequency partitioning is not a reasonable solution
(Römer 2013). Crickets, on the other hand, use almost
pure-tone calling songs, usually in the range of 2–10 kHz
(Elliott and Koch 1985; Riede 1993; Bennet-Clark 1998;
Montealegre et al. 2011), of narrow spectral bandwidth
which should allow them to separate their signals in the
frequency domain. Riede (1993) provided support for this
idea, showing that distinct spacing of carrier frequencies
of different cricket species can be realized and suggested
partitioning of the transmission channel due to acoustic
competition.
In a more quantitative approach, Schmidt et al. (2013)
and Jain et al. (2014) determined the degree of acoustic
competition and partitioning in an entire assemblage based
on extensive acoustic monitoring in the tropical rainforests
of Barro Colorado (Panama) and KNP (India), respectively.
Both studies demonstrated that, on average, call frequency
overlap within a cricket assemblage (Schmidt et al. 2013)
and an assemblage consisting of crickets and katydids (Jain
et al. 2013) is extremely low, with little or no spectral overlap for the majority of species pairs. One solution to the
problem of interspecific interference may thus be for each
species to have its own frequency channel (Riede 1997).
To test whether this is so, however, one needs to establish
that the observed spectral separation in the assemblage is
unlikely to be an outcome of random chance over evolutionary time scales.
In case of the cricket assemblage investigated by
Schmidt et al. (2013), the spectral overlap of the observed
community was significantly smaller than expected by
chance when compared to a null model (Gotelli and
Graves 1996). Moreover, species also tended to use a

J Comp Physiol A (2015) 201:133–142	

The receiver’s perspective: strategies for hearing in noise
The niche concept discussed so far examines different axes
of call structure or calling behaviour along which species
may diverge and hence escape acoustic interference. From
a physiological point of view masking interference is, however, ultimately a problem of the receiver and requires to be
examined from a receiver’s perspective. Whereas examining the niche axes of time, space and frequency separately
is convenient, the actual interference experienced by an
individual receiver will depend not only on a combination
of factors, which includes temporal and spectral overlap
of signals, but also upon relative positions of callers and
receivers, call intensities at source, call attenuation along
the transmission path and hearing sensitivity and frequency
response of the receivers (Jain et al. 2014). Estimating the
amount of masking interference thus requires an integrated
model that takes into account all the above factors. Such an
integrated simulation model of 3-D acoustic active spaces
was developed for a subset of cricket and katydid species
of the KNP assemblage and used to estimate the probability
of effective acoustic overlap (EAO) experienced by individual receivers of different species in multispecies choruses (Jain et al. 2014). Incredibly, the median and modal
values of EAO were close to zero, suggesting that the levels
of acoustic interference experienced by individuals in these
apparently noisy environments are very low (Fig. 1; Jain
et al. 2014).
The simulation models also allowed dissection of the
roles of different factors such as call intensity and frequency tuning in reducing acoustic interference (Jain et al.
2014): it was found that calling louder was always a good
strategy to reduce spatial masking interference, irrespective
of the call structures of the interacting species. The most

greater range of frequency channels for intraspecific communication if the frequency space was not constrained by
the frequency range of other calling species, suggesting
that frequency partitioning of calling songs might indeed
be an evolutionary outcome of selection against interspecific frequency overlap. In the nocturnal signalling acoustic assemblage in Borneo examined by Grant (2014),
consisting of cricket, katydid and frog species, the overall levels of spectral niche overlap were also low but not
significantly lower than expected by chance when tested
against a null model.
In principle, the competition for signal space can exert
selection pressure on both senders and receivers. Thus,
selection should act on signals leading to displacement of
mating traits and preferences for those signals resulting in
behavioural isolation and consequently to the reduction of
signal interference and reduced competition in signal space
(Hoskin and Higgie 2010; Mendelson and Shaw 2012).

conspecific active space is overlapped by heterospecific signals, given
tuned receivers. Callers are at the centres of the spheres. Distances on
the X, Y and Z axes are in metres and inter-male distances represent
natural values

powerful strategy to reduce masking interference, however,
was tuning receivers to match sender call frequency range
(Jain et al. 2014).
Frequency tuning
A fundamental solution to enhance the detection of conspecific signals under noisy conditions was proposed by
Capranica and Moffat (1983), wherein there is a match
between the frequency band containing maximum energy
in the signal and the frequency of maximum auditory sensitivity of the receiver (i.e. matched filters), thus improving
the signal-to-noise ratio (Wehner 1987; Simmons 2013).
However, not only is the match between the signaller’s call
and the receiver sensitivity important but also the sharpness of the receiver tuning is crucial, particularly in environments with high acoustic noise levels. In habitats with
non-overlapping acoustic signals (i.e. a setting without
acoustic competition) relatively broad frequency selectivity
has been observed in European field crickets (e.g. Gryllus
bimaculatus and Gryllus campestris), whereas a comparative study in the rainforest of BCI revealed sharply tuned
frequency selectivity in cricket species living within a large
assemblage of acoustically co-active species (Kostarakos
et al. 2008, 2009; Schmidt et al. 2011, 2013; Schmidt and
Römer 2011).

neuronal filters of the rainforest and the European species were implemented into audio software and applied on
sound recordings of natural background noise (Fig. 2). The
results clearly demonstrated strongly increased noise suppression for the filter of tropical species, leading to a significantly better extraction of the species-specific song pattern and its amplitude modulation when embedded in noise
(Schmidt et al. 2011).
In a continuative approach the insect was placed in the
nocturnal rainforest to observe directly the narrow tuned
filter properties by analysing the readout of an acoustic
scene encoded in the action potential activity of an auditory
interneuron (AN1) under natural conditions. The results
revealed highly selective coding of conspecific songs in
receivers, whereas irrelevant noise mainly within the higher
frequency noise band was successfully filtered out (Schmidt
and Römer 2011). In the rainforest of BCI similar sharp frequency filters have been found in different members of the
subfamilies Oecanthinae and Podoscirtinae, suggesting an
advantageous role to cope with the high level of background

13

noise of heterospecifics rather than being solely the outcome
of phylogenetic constraint (Schmidt et al. 2011).
Frequency selectivity in receivers, coupled with matched
frequency partitioning in senders, thus represents a powerful strategy for noise reduction and signal detection, enabling intraspecific communication in habitats with high
acoustic diversity.
Spatial release from masking and gain control
Interestingly, co-occurring species that have been detected
simultaneously in sound recordings and thus temporally
overlap are not necessarily doomed to fail to communicate
successfully. Signal detection against heterospecific noise
and also in dense populations of conspecific individuals
can be substantially improved by mechanisms known as
spatial release from masking and gain control (also referred
to as selective attention: Pollack 1988). Although these
mechanisms have been investigated in a neurophysiological rather than behavioural context in the afferent auditory

J Comp Physiol A (2015) 201:133–142	

pathway of crickets and katydids, they can provide important insights into how insects solve cocktail party-like problems of natural auditory scenes.
The basic principle of spatial release from masking is
that when two auditory objects (e.g. conspecific signal and
masker) are spatially separated, the detection of a sound
signal will be improved (Bee 2008, 2012). Owing to the
directionality of the hearing system these auditory objects
are selectively processed when arriving at the ear from different directions (Bradbury and Vehrencamp 2011). Such
a situation will be most likely encountered in complex
auditory scenes of natural environments such as nocturnal
rainforests where multiple sound sources are distributed in
space.
In laboratory experiments, signal detection thresholds
in the cricket Paroecanthus podagrosus were significantly
improved by 6–9 dB when the signal (i.e. conspecific calling song) and masker (i.e. nocturnal background noise)
were spatially separated by 180° (Schmidt and Römer
2011). Similarly, in the katydid Tettigonia viridissima neuronal representation of auditory objects is strongly favoured
on the ipsilateral side while strongly suppressed when coming from the contralateral side (Römer and Krusch 2000).
Even a spatial separation of two concurrent sound signals
of merely 15° in the frontal zone of the animal will result
in a reliable representation of the ipsilateral signal in the
omega neuron (an identified auditory interneuron in crickets and katydids: Römer and Krusch 2000).
In addition to spatial release from masking, gain control
is another neuronal mechanism allowing crickets and katydids to accomplish the task of sound source segregation in
chorus situations. In engineering, gain control describes
an electronic circuit where the dynamic range of an input
signal is automatically controlled to produce a constant
output signal. Such a mechanism was first reported for the
omega neuron in crickets, which selectively encodes the
more intense signal in the presence of a signal with lower
intensity, based on combined synaptic activity of inhibitory-excitatory effects (Pollack 1986, 1988; Sobel and Tank
1994; Baden and Hedwig 2007; Römer 2013). Moreover, in
a neurophysiological approach mimicking a natural chorus
situation, with competitive signals arriving from the same
direction, an intensity difference in the range of 2–5 dB
was sufficient to suppress the less intense of two signals
(Römer and Krusch 2000). The authors also showed that,
when presenting two stimuli from the same side, the louder
signal (broadcast at 60 dB SPL) was almost exclusively
represented in the omega neuron (i.e. a constant neuronal
output) and the less intense signal was suppressed over a
wide range of intensities (30–50 dB SPL; i.e. the dynamic
range of an input signal). That such a gain control mechanism can be potentially relevant in natural auditory scenes
has been shown by Schmidt and Römer (2011). In playback

139

experiments, the AN1 activity of irrelevant sound occurring in intervals of conspecific signals was considerably
decreased, leading to an enhanced contrast between signal
and natural background noise. However, an open question
remains as to what extent both mechanisms improve the
female’s discrimination ability under real-world listening
conditions.
Novelty detection
It was recently demonstrated that a small change in the
spectrum of a broadband signal can have a significant
impact on efficient communication. This was shown in the
case of two sympatric Malaysian katydid species of the
Mecopoda complex (Siegert et al. 2013) where a chirping
species is heavily masked by a loud trilling species. However, Mecopoda chirper males show an extreme behavioural
robustness of chorus synchrony against the background
noise of the trilling species owing to the higher amount of
spectral energy at 2 kHz in their chirps when compared to
the song of Mecopoda triller.
The selective neuronal response of a local interneuron (TN1) to conspecific signals (“chirps”) under natural
noisy conditions (“trill”) offers an elegant solution to the
observed behavioural results, referred as to “novelty detection” (Schul and Sheridan 2006; Schul et al. 2012; Siegert
et al. 2013). The stimulus-specific adaptation of this neuron towards the continuous trill leads to a fast and almost
complete decrease in neuronal activity and enables the reliable coding of simultaneously presented Mecopoda chirps.
Thus, such a neuronal novelty detector for conspecific signals can provide a useful receiver strategy under certain
regimes of background noise (e.g. multi-species choruses).

Anthropogenic noise
Another form of environmental noise with impacts on
acoustic communication systems is the one that emerges
from human activities. Recent work has revealed the negative impact of traffic noise with its consequences on reproductive success and foraging efficiency in birds (Halfwerk
et al. 2011) and bats (Siemers and Schaub 2011). In vertebrates one commonly observed effect in response to anthropogenic noise is an upward shift in call frequency (Slabbekoorn and Peet 2003; Slabbekoorn and den Boer-Visser
2006; Bermúdez-Cuamatzin et al. 2011; Hage et al. 2013).
Road traffic noise contains considerable amount of
energy in the frequency range between 6 and 9 kHz and is
able to mask the local frequency maximum of the courtship
song of C. biguttulus males (Lampe et al. 2012), which is
also highly attractive to females (von Helversen and von
Helversen 1997). Males from roadside habitats call at

13

	
140

higher local frequency maxima of 300 Hz on average compared to males from quiet habitats (Lampe et al. 2012).
Moreover, nymphs that were exposed to road noise during
their development also produced signals with higher frequency components as adults compared with males reared
under quiet conditions, suggesting developmental plasticity
as a potential mechanism for this type of signal adjustment
(Lampe et al. 2014). Similarly, Shieh et al. (2012) found for
the cicada species Cryptotympana takasagona an increase
of song frequency in areas along roads with vehicular traffic and parking lots.

Acoustic monitoring
Insect sounds provide an ideal opportunity for monitoring
biodiversity because the heterogeneity of an acoustic environment is usually correlated with biodiversity (Sueur et al.
2008). The major sound producing insect groups, namely
crickets, katydids, grasshoppers and cicadas are found
worldwide and over a range of different habitat and microhabitat types (Samways and Sergeev 1997). Being small
and poikilothermic, they are sensitive to and thus act as
good indicators of landscape and climate change (Samways
and Sergeev 1997). Many of them produce species-specific
songs and calls, allowing acoustic signatures to be used as
a proxy for species identification (Riede 1993). Non-invasive acoustic monitoring of species diversity and activity
is thus enabled, using either psychoacoustic sampling with
trained listeners (Diwakar et al. 2007) or call recordings,
wherein species with known acoustic signals may be identified from spectrograms (Diwakar et al. 2007; Schmidt
et al. 2013). There are also currently attempts to automate
species recognition based on acoustic signals using different computational algorithms and these new technologies
should allow automated long-term recording and analysis,
including in remote areas (Aide et al. 2013). Given the
enormous diversity and the lack of detailed taxonomic and
acoustic information for many species, especially in the
tropics, another approach to acoustic profiling is to identify
‘acoustic taxonomic units’ based on distinct temporal and
spectral properties of calls revealed in spectrograms (Grant
2014). Even though all the species may not be physically
identified, this approach allows useful comparisons of species diversity between different habitats and land-use patterns (Grant 2014).
A different approach, which does not employ species or
signal pattern identification, is to use acoustic entropy or
spectro-temporal heterogeneity as a measure of diversity
(Sueur et al. 2008; Depratere et al. 2012; Gasc et al. 2013).
This is a form of soundscape ecology (Pijanowski et al.
2011), wherein recordings of the entire soundscape are analysed as units and compared across different habitats and

13

J Comp Physiol A (2015) 201:133–142

vegetation types. Heterogeneity of soundscapes has been
found to be correlated with different habitats and vegetation types (Bormpoudakis et al. 2013) and holds promise
for rapid assessment and monitoring of biodiversity: detectable acoustic gaps could serve as a ‘warning system’ for a
disturbed ecosystem (Riede 1993; Pijanowski et al. 2011).
Acoustic monitoring of Tettigoniidae revealed large-scale
effects of anthropogenic pressure due to urbanisation and
agriculture, with negative impacts on species richness,
diversity and abundance (Penone et al. 2013).
Insect sounds contribute heavily to natural soundscapes,
especially nocturnal ones and are thus important in the context of acoustic monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Acoustic insects, with their fascinating and familiar diversity of sounds, have been an integral part of natural ecosystems and soundscapes for millions of years and deserve
our respect and protection in the face of the current unprecedented rates of habitat destruction and climate change.
