Abstract
A major goal of landscape ecology is to understand the formation, dynamics, and maintenance of spatial heterogeneity. Spatial heterogeneity is the most fundamental characteristic of all landscapes, and scale multiplicity is
inherent in spatial heterogeneity. Thus, multiscale analysis is imperative for understanding the structure, function and dynamics of landscapes. Although a number of methods have been used for multiscale analysis in landscape ecology since the 1980s, the effectiveness of many of them, including some commonly used ones, is not clear
or questionable. In this paper, we discuss two approaches to multiscale analysis of landscape heterogeneity: the
direct and indirect approaches. We will focus on scale variance and semivariance methods in the first approach
and 17 landscape metrics in the second. The results show that scale variance is potentially a powerful method to
detect and describe multiple-scale structures of landscapes, while semivariance analysis may often fail to do so
especially if landscape variability is dominant a t broad scales over fine scales. Landscape metrics respond to
changing grain size rather differently, and these changes are reflective of the modifiable areal unit problem as well
as multiple-scale structures in landscape pattern. Interestingly, some metrics (e.g., the number of patches, patch
density, total edge, edge density, mean patch size, patch size coefficient of variation) exhibit consistent, predictable
patterns over a wide range of grain sizes, whereas others (e.g.,patch diversity, contagion, landscape fractal dimension) have nonlinear response curves. The two approaches to multiple-scale analysis are complementary, and their
pros and cons still need to be further investigated systematically.

I. INTRODUCTION
Spatial heterogeneity is ubiquitous in nature across
all scales, and its formation and interactions with ecological processes are the central issue in landscape
ecology. It is intriguing, however, to note that the spatial dimension has long been ignored or purposefully
avoided in ecology given that all ecological phenomena take place in spatially heterogeneous environments and that the relationship between organisms
and their environment is the very subject of ecology.
This ignorance has had much to do with the background assumption of balance of nature and the traditional equilibrium paradigm in ecology (Wu and
Loucks 1995). Besides, several reasons are attributable to the slow progress in spatial ecology, i.e., the
spatially explicit study of the interactions between
pattern and process in ecological systems.
The first is the lack of recognition of the importance
of the interactions between space and other factors
that together give rise to ecological patterns or processes. Although plant ecologists have long been interested in the geographical distribution of commu-

nities since the 1800s,the interactions between space
and ecological processes have not been well studied.
It was not until the 1980s that the interaction among
pattern, process and scale began to occupy a central
place in ecological studies, especially, with developments in patch dynamics a n d hierarchy theory
(O'Neill et al. 1986, Levin 1992, Wu and Levin 1994,
Wu and Loucks 1995). The second reason concerns
the lack of effective statistical and modeling methods
for studying spatial phenomena. Many, if not most,
statistical methods traditionally used in ecological
research assume the independence of the observations.
Spatial autocorrelation and spatial dependence, however, are extremely common for ecological variables
(Legendre 1993), which violate this fundamental assumption, thus impairing methods that are based on
it. Although there are ways of removing spatiaI structure in data, doing so may not be ecologically sensible
if space is considered an integral part of ecological
phenomena. Only in recent years, new methods in
spatial statistics (particularly geostatistics) began to
be introduced in ecology to alleviate this problem (e.g.,

which mag be caused by different processes, and thus
the scale of observation significantly influences what
is to be observed; (3) understanding landscape functioning requires a multiple-scale characterization of
spatial pattern and processes, and single-scale descriptions are doomed to be partial and misleading; and
(4) models developed a t one particular scale are not
likely to apply at other scales, thus we need to either
link models developed a t different scales, or develop
multiple-scaled or hierarchically structured models.

Vol. 6. No. 1,June 2000

The third reason has to do with the insufficient capacity of computers. Spatial analysis usually requires
enormous memory space, high computing speed, and
complex software development. All of these have been
limiting factors in much of the history of ecology as
well as statistics. Fortunately, these problems are now
greatly eased with rapid advances in computer technologies, including the availability of GIS. The fourth
reason involves problems arising from data aggregation, which often lead to error propagation and controversial results. Ecological studies frequently use
area-based information, derived from field surveys,
aerial photography, or remote sensing sources. The
boundaries of the areal units, however, are usually
arbitrary. As Greig-Smith (1983) pointed out, there is
a n “element of subjectivity in sampling procedure because the boundaries within which a set of samples is
taken are fixed by the ecologist on the basis of his
judgment of what can suitably be described a s one
unit for the purpose a t hand.” The arbitrariness in
the definition of areal units can affect the results of a
number of statistical analyses. This problem has been
known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)
in the geographical literature (Openshaw 1984), and
has recently been studied in the context of landscape
ecology (Wu and Jelinski 1995, Jelinski and Wu 1996).
MAUP consists of two closely related aspects: the scale
problem and the zoning problem. The scale problem
concerns changes in the results of spatial analysis with
changing scale (usually grain size), whereas the zoning problem results from the variations of the results
of spatial analysis due t o different zoning systems or
spatial configurations of areal units at the same scale.
The studies of MAUP have shown that a wide variety
of spatial analyses and simulation models are susceptible to both scale and zoning problems (Jelinski and
Wu 1996, Marceau 1999). As a result, the composition of a landscape (e.g., patches, gaps, edges, and corridors) may also vary with changing grain size and
extent.
To understand the dynamics of patterns and processes
and their interactions in a heterogeneous landscape,
one must be able to accurately quantify the spatial
pattern and its temporal changes of the landscape.
Recent studies have shown that one of the most important and universal characteristics of spatial heterogeneity is its scale multiplicity in space (e.g., Miller
1978, Kolasa and Pickett 1991, Wu and Loucks 1995,
Cullinan et al. 1997, Werner 1999). This scale multiplicity of landscapes has several important ecological
implications: (1) landscapes may be, though not necessarily, hierarchically structured; (2) landscapes exhibit distinctive spatial patterns at different scales

The process of extrapolating or translating information from one scale to another, scaling, undoubtedly is
a fundamental challenge in both theory and practice
across all earth sciences. In particular, scaling is essential for addressing a wide range of ecological and
environmental problems concerning biodiversity loss
and global change in part because most ecological studies to date have been carried out at very local scales
in both time and space (van Gardingen et al. 1997,
Wu 1999). Scaling often is a difficult task due primarily to landscape heterogeneity and nonlinearity, and
understanding the scale multiplicity in pattern and
process is a key to the success of scaling (Wu 1999).
This paper, therefore, discusses two approaches to
multiscale analysis of landscape pattern: the direct
and indirect approaches. Specifically, we demonstrate
how to use scale variance analysis a n d landscape
metrics as methods for detecting and describing multiple-scale or hierarchical structures in landscapes.
Through a series of analyses, we address several specific questions, including: Is scale variance effective
in detecting multiple-scale patterns? How does it compare with semivariance? How do landscape metrics
change over a broad range of grain sizes? Are these
changes predictable? Which landscape indices are
sensitive to multiple-scale structures?

11. TWO APPROACHES TO MULTISCALE
ANALYSES
To quantify multiple-scale characteristics of landscapes, multiscale or hierarchical approaches must be
employed. While a hierarchical approach is by definition multiple-scale, a multiple-scale approach is not
necessarily hierarchical in the sense of the nested hierarchy (Wu 1999). I t is worth noting that the term,
“scale”, here is used to denote the grain size and extent of a data set, not necessarily corresponding to
the “characteristic scale” of landscape pattern or processes. We may distinguish between two general approaches to multiscale analyses: (1) t h e direct
multiscale approach that uses inherently multiplescale methods, and (2) the indirect multiscale approach
that uses single-scale methods repeatedly at differ-

ent scales. Frequently used multi-scale methods in
landscape ecology include semivariance analysis
(Robertson and Gross 1994, Burrough 1995), wavelet
analysis (Bradshaw and Spies 1992, Saunders et al.
1998), spectral analysis (Platt and Denman 1975,
Ripley 1978), fractal analysis (Krummel 1987, Milne
1991,Nikora et al. 1999),lacunarity analysis (Plotnick
et al.1993,Henebry and Kux 1995),and blocking quadrat variance analysis (Greig-Smith 1983, Dale 1999).
All these methods contain multiple-scale components
in their mathematical formulation or procedures, and
thus are either hierarchical or multiscaled.
On the other hand, the indirect approach to multiscale
analyses can use methods that are designed for singlescale analysis, such as the wide variety of landscape
metrics (e.g., diversity, contagion, perimeter-area ratios, spatial autocorrelation indices) as well as statistical measures (e.g., mean, variance, correlation or
regression coefficients). The scale multiplicity in the
indirect approach is realized by resampling the data
at different scales, albeit grain or extent, and then
repeatedly computing the metrics or statistical measures using the resampled data a t different scales.
One particular way of resampling data is to systematically aggregate the original fine-resolution data set
and produce a hierarchically nested data set, which
leads to a hierarchical analysis using single-scale
methods. Note that hierarchical analysis does not
have to assume, apriori, the existence of a hierarchical structure in the landscape under study, but can be
used to detect it.
In general, there are two related but distinctive goals
for conducting a multiscale analysis in a landscape
ecological study. The first is to characterize the multiple-scale structure of a landscape. The second is to
detect or identify “scale breaks” or hierarchical levels
in the landscape which often can be studied as a spatially nested hierarchy (O’Neill et al. 1991, Wu and
Loucks 1995,Wu 1999). In both cases, a better understanding is achieved of how spatial heterogeneity
changes with scale. However, a description of landscape pattern a t different scales may be necessary or
desirable even if scale breaks do not exist or the landscape is not hierarchical. On the other hand, scale
breaks often lead to the identification of characteristic scales of patterns which may frequently facilitate
understanding underlying processes. A series of methods for analyzing landscape heterogeneity have been
reviewed recently (e.g., Turner et al. 1991, Burrough
1995, Gustafson 1998,Dale 1999, Fortin 1999). In the
following, we demonstrate two multiscale approaches
with specific examples. In particular, we focus on the
use of scale variance analysis and several landscape
metrics as they are used in multiscale analysis.

111. MULTISCALE ANALYSES WITH SCALE
VARIANCE
Scale variance analysis is a hierarchical analysis that
was first developed by Moellering and Tobler (1972).
The initial goal of the method was to determine the
relative variability a t each level in a known nested
hierarchy, and to evaluate each level’s relative, independent contribution to the total variability of the
whole system. However, the use of scale variance
analysis does not necessarily require or even assume
the existence of a nested hierarchy in the landscape
under study. To conduct scale variance analysis, one
only needs to systematically aggregate spatial data
by increasing grain size progressively so that a nested
data hierarchy is formed (see Figure 1). Each grain
size is termed a “scale level” (Moellering and Tobler
1972). Most spatial data can be reconstructed hierarchically by resampling, then scale variance analysis
can be applied (Moellering a n d Tobler 1972,
Townshend and Justice 1990,Wu et al. 1994, Barnsley
et al. 1997).
The statistical model of scale variance can be expressed as:

.X$...; = p + a ; + p , + yijk+“‘+oiik...~
where Xjk...zisthe value of a spatial unit (e.g., a pixel)
at the hierarchical level that corresponds to the finest grain size (scale level 6 in Figure l), p the grand
mean over the entire data set, a, the effect of the a
level (scale level 1in Figure l), pijthe effect of the p
level (scale level 2 in Figure l),yijk the effect of the y
level (scale level 3 in Figure l),and aijk...z the effect of
o level (scale level 6 in Figure 1).
From the above model, the total variance of the landscape can be partitioned hierarchically a t different
grain sizes. Moellering and Tobler (1972) derived the
scale variance components for a 3-level (a,p, y) hierarchy as follows. First, the total variation of the system is expressed as the total sum of squares:

where I is the number of a level units, Jiis the number of b level units in each itha level unit, and K is
the number of y level units in each ijth p level unig!
The total sum of squares is partitioned into different
parts that are attributable to the various scale levels
(here a, p, y), so that

Dividing the partitioned sums of squares by their respective degrees of freedom results in the corresponding mean square estimates, i.e.:

Scale variance analysis starts with the construction
of nested data hierarchies (Figure l),and then the
above equations are used to compute the total sum of
squares, partitioned sums of squares, and scale variance at each scale level. Finally, scale variance or the
percent total sum of squares is plotted against scale
levels, resulting in the scale variance graph, from
which one can readily visualize the presence of peaks
or the lack of them. A peak implies that high variability occurs at the corresponding scale level (grain
size), which is indicative .of the average size of dominant patches in the landscape. The height of the peak
reflects the relative contribution of that particular
scale level to the total variability of the landscape.
Let’s take a look at two simple examples of how scale
variance works, and compare it with semivariance
analysis. Figure 2 shows two artificially constructed
“landscapes” with multiple-scale patterns in which
patches of different sizes form spatially nested hierarchies, i.e., larger patches are composed of smaller
patches. The left column in Figure 2 is the pictorial
version (for facilitating visualization) of the numerical map on the right (actually used in the following
analyses). Can scale variance reveal this hierarchical structure? Is it more effective than, say, the simple
variance, spatial autocorrelation, and semivariance
analysis?
Figure 3 shows that scale variance is indeed able to
correctly and clearly identify three peaks corresponding to the three patch sizes (i.e., 1x1, 8x8 and 16x16
BSUs, where BSU stands for the basic spatial unit
that is defined as the pixel in the original data set).

Figure 2. Two artificially constructed landscapes that exhibit multiple-scale patterns. The left column is the
pictorial version of the numerical map on the right.
Simple variance exhibits a staircase curve, also indicative of a hierarchical structure in the landscape,
but not as conspicuous as scale variance (especially
for the scale level of 16x16 BSUs). The graph of spatial autocorrelation against scale levels (similar to, but
not the same as, a correlogram) also indicates a multiple-scale structure, but is not as easy to interpret as
scale variance. Results for the second landscape (pattern 2) for the three methods further support the above
observations. Here, three zoning alternatives are used,
and in each case scale variance unambiguously reveals two or three hierarchical levels in the data set.
Note that changing zoning systems affects the results
of all three methods, which is part of MAUP (Jelinski
and Wu 1996). At the same time, by knowing how the

zones are oriented during the data aggregation, scale
variance can provide information on the directionality of dominant elongated patches (see pattern 2 in
Figure 2 and the scale variance graph for zoning system 2 in Figure 4).
Figure 5 summarizes the results of a semivariance
analysis of these two contrived landscapes. The graph
at the top in each column shows that semivariance
exhibits cyclic fluctuations, indicative of the periodic
pattern in the two landscapes. While this periodicity
is not specious, it is difficult to discern whether there
exist hierarchical scales in these landscapes and how
many from these semivariograms. We also divided
the landscapes into four horizontal transects (8x32

and spatial autocorrelation indices are also provided for comparison. The horizontal axis for all three graphs

pixels each), with transect 1 at the top and transect 4
at the bottom. The semivariogram for the top transect
in each landscape seems to indicate a scale break at
the lag of 8 pixels, whereas the other three transects
exhibit rather similar semivariograms without obvious scale breaks. In all cases, semivariance analysis
does not seem to be able to clearly identify the hierarchical levels that apparently exist in the two landscapes. We further compare scale variance with
semivariance analysis using a real landscape data set
(a map of NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index), with 300x300 pixels each of which has a 30 m
linear dimension. The landscape is a boreal forest
region, composed of a large number of patches of different vegetation types that vary greatly in size. In
Figure 6, scale variance and the percent total sum of
squares (top) both show several peaks, indicative of
the existence of a multiple-scale structure in the landscape. However, for real landscapes scale variance
does not drop to near zero between scale levels, as for

the contrived landscapes, because patch sizes may
vary continuously, although not evenly; i.e., the nested
patch hierarchies are not “neatly”organized. The variance plot (bottom) seems to corroborate this result,
but is much less conspicuous. On the other hand, the
semivariogram shows that semivariance increases
rapidly initially with increasing lags and then gradually levels off (Figure 7). The multiscale structure of
the landscape does not become discernable from either the semivariogramfor the entire landscape (top)
or for the three transects (bottom three).

Iv.MULTISCALE ANALYSES WITH PATTERN
INDICES
The indirect multiscale analysis is closely related to
the study of the problem of spatial aggregation in general and MAUP in particular (Wu and Jelinski 1995,
Jelinski and Wu 1996). Here we focus on the ques-

12

Wu et al.: Multiscale Analysis of Landscape Heterogeneity

Downloaded by [USP University of Sao Paulo] at 11:45 24 February 2014

tion: how different landscape pattern indices respond
to systematic changes in grain size a s a spatial data
set is progressively aggregated with its extent kept
constant. We compute a series of landscape metrics
using FRAGSTATS (McGarigal and Marks 1995)
based on a land cover classification map of a n urbanrural-desert landscape in Nevada, USA, occupying a n
area of 900 km2. The classification was conducted
using a 1984 Landsat TM scene. The landscape was
dominated by different arid vegetation types (e.g., different types of shrublands and woodlands) as well as
burned, agricultural, and urban areas.

gated, the number of patch types (patch richness) and
patch diversity (Shannon-Weaver diversity index) both
decrease monotonically (the two graphs at the bottom in Figure 8). While the staircase-like decline in
patch richness is readily understandable, decreasing
patch diversity is a result of the combined decrease in
both the number of patch types and the evenness of
each type. Comparing patch richness and diversity
graphs reveals that the initial rapid decrease in diversity is due to decreasing evenness, whereas later
changes in diversity closely resemble those in patch
richness. The exact pattern of patch richness and diversity with increasing grain size is determined significantly by the details of landscape heterogeneity
(Turner et al. 1989, Wickham and Riitters 1995, Wu
et al. 1997).

In total, seventeen commonly used landscape metrics
are examined systematically. The total amount of
edge, number of patches, edge density, and patch density all show a remarkably consistent power-law relationship with increasing grain size, suggesting that
these indices can be predicted over a wide range of
grain sizes with high accuracy (the first four graphs
in Figure 8). As data become more and more aggre-

Contagion index has been widely used to measure the
extent to which patches of the same type are clumped
(O’Neill et al. 1988, Li and Reynolds 1993, Riitters et
al. 1996). One may expect that contagion should in-

crease monotonically with increasing grain size simply because of the progressive agglomeration of
smaller patches into larger ones of the same type.
However, this is not the case here. Figure 9 shows
that contagion increases up to a certain grain size and
then begins to decline. In fact, for a given spatial pattern a finer grain size renders a larger contagion
(Frohn 1998). Because several factors, including patch
diversity, spatial pattern, and grain size, together affect the value of contagion (see Li and Reynolds 1993,
Riitters et al. 1996), it is difficult, if meaningful, to
interpret its response curve. Square pixel index

(Frohn 1998) and landscape shape index are both derived from the perimeter-area ratio. As grain size increases, landscape shape index decreases rapidly following a power law, whereas square pixel, a normalized shape index, decreases linearly (Figure 9). In
contrast with the assertions by Frohn (1998), the insensitivity of square pixel to changing grain size suggests that it may not be a good measure for detecting
changes in landscape shape complexity across scales
or along a gradient (also see Wu in review). The fractal
dimension of the landscape remains constant over a
range of grain sizes, which may suggest self-similar-

ity, and then begins to fluctuate after grain size exceeds 50 pixels on a side. Together with contagion,
the landscape fractal graph may be indicative of different landscape features emerging over coarse grain
sizes. These features are more than likely “spatial”
because the non-spatial measures, like landscape
shape index and square pixel index, do not pick up
this information (Figure 9).
Figure 10 shows the response curves of mean patch
size (MPS), patch size coefficient of variation (PSCV),
mean patch fractal dimension (MPFD), area-weighted
mean patch fractal dimension (AWMFD), patch size
standard deviation (PSSD), mean patch shape index
(MSI), and area-weighted mean patch shape index
(AWMSI). It is trivial to speculate that MPS will increase with increasing grain size in any landscape.
Yet, it is interesting to note that the increase in MPS
is readily predictable and that its pattern seems to
indicate multiple-scale patterns existing at grain sizes
of about 60x60 and 80x80 pixels. This scale multiplicity in landscape pattern again is noticeable in the response curves of AWMFD, PSSD, MSI, and AWMSI
(Figure 10). While patch size standard deviation in-

creases almost linearly with increasing grain size,
patch size coefficient of variation, ie., patch size standard deviation divided by mean patch size, decreases
again in a power-law fashion (Figure 10). Mean patch
fractal dimension does not change notably with grain
size, but area-weighted mean patch fractal dimension
demonstrates a rapid nonlinear decline which is similar to that of area-weighted mean patch shape index.
Also noticeable is mean patch shape index which
seems sensitive to changing grain size, and thus may
be used together with MPS, AWMFD, PSSD, and
AWMSI to detect, in addition to describing, multiscale
patterns in landscapes.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The relationship between pattern and scale is extremely intriguing and important in ecology (Levin
1992), but remains elusive even when pattern is restricted to spatial pattern and scale to grain and extent. Detecting, describing and understanding the
multiple-scale structure of spatial heterogeneity are
essential in landscape ecology, or more appropriately,
spatial ecology. Although many methods have been
used to achieve this goal in landscape ecology since
the 1980s, the effectiveness of even the most widely
used methods (e.g., correlograms, variograms) remains
unclear or questionable.

In this paper, we outline two complementary, yet parallel approaches to multiscale analysis of landscape
pattern: the direct approach that uses multiscale statistical methods and the indirect approach that usually employs simple synoptic pattern indices with hierarchically resampled data. In particular, we illustrate the use of scale variance analysis with contrived
landscape data as well as a real landscape data set.
Semivariance analysis and spatial autocorrelation
analysis are used for the purpose of comparison. The
results show that scale variance analysis seems to be
a more robust method for detecting and describing
multiple-scale or hierarchical structures of landscapes.
Townshend and Justice (1988,1990) have shown that
scale variance analysis is just as powerful as complicated methods such a s spectral analysis, but much

simpler in computation and much more transparent
in interpretation. Although semivariance analysishas
been claimed as one of the most effective methods for
detecting the multi-scale or hierarchical structure of
landscapes, our results here suggest that this may not
always be true. In semivariograms of real landscapes,
fine-scale variability can be "squeezed"by broad-scale
variability, which makes it less likely for a clearlyidentifiable staircase curve (e.g., Robertson and Gross
1994) to emerge. Meisel and Turner (1998) also
pointed out that, although semivariance analysis did
reveal the hierarchical structure in their artificial
maps, it is unlikely to detect multiscale patterns in
real landscapes.
The results of our multiscale analysis with seventeen
commonly used landscape pattern metrics show that
almost all of them change considerably with increasing grain size. These changes reflect the notorious
problem known as MAUP and, at least sometimes,the
multiple-scale structure in landscape pattern. Some
metrics (e.g., the number of patches, patch density,
total edge, edge density, mean patch size, patch size
coefficient of variation) seem to exhibit consistent
patterns over a wide range of grain sizes, and thus
can be predicted accurately with simple regression
equations. On the other hand, nonlinear response

curves are found for other metrics (e.g., patch diversity, contagion,landscape fractal dimension). It makes
little sense to characterizelandscape pattern with any
of these indices at a single scale, be it grain or extent.
While a multiple-scale analysiswith several landscape
metrics across scales is necessary for meaningfully
describing landscape pattern, doing so can also render valuable information on detecting possible scale
multiplicity in the pattern.
All spatial data and all types of spatial analysis carry
errors of one sort or another (Fotheringham 1989).
The usefulness of a spatial study may be critically
affected by the nature and the intrinsic meaningfulness of the objects or units in the data set (Openshaw
1984). The multiple-scale analyses discussed here are
intimately related to the problem of spatial aggregation in statistics and human geography in general.
Specifically, MAUP may have significant influences
on the detection of scale, the determination of relationships among organizational levels, and the translation of information across scales. Indeed, the modifiable areal unit problem suggests that results of many
past ecological studies based on spatially aggregated
data may be flawed or seriously biased and, therefore, should be reexamined. There is apparently a
lack of awareness of the vast literature on MAUP in
