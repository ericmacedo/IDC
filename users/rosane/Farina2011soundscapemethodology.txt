The soundscape represents the acoustic footprint of a landscape, and may well be a source of a vast amount of
information that could be used efﬁciently in, for example, long-term bird aggregation monitoring schemes. To
depict such soundscape footprint, speciﬁc indexes are requested. In particular, the aim of this paper was to
extensively describe the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) and to successively apply it to process the sound
ﬁles recorded in an ecologically fragile area in a Mediterranean maqui (Eastern Liguria, Italy). Daily acoustic
animal activity was sampled in 90 one-minute ﬁles between the end of May and the end of July, 2010, using a
pre-programmed recording procedure (Songmeter, Wildlife Acoustic). The WaveSurfer software, powered by
the Soundscape Metric plug-in, was then utilized to quickly process these data.
This approach allows the identiﬁcation of the compositional changes and acoustic ﬂuctuations activity of a
local community (in the proposed case prevalently composed by birds and cicadas). In particular, two distinct
patterns emerged during the investigation. From 20 May to 4 July, the soundscape was dominated by birds
but, after that period, the onset of the cicadas' songs completely changed the sound dynamics. The proposed
methodology has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to identify the complex patterns of the soundscape
across different temporal scales (hours, days and intraseason). This approach could also be adopted in longterm studies to monitor animal dynamics under different environmental scenarios.

1. Introduction
Over recent decades, the growing human intrusion into the Earth's
ecosystems has led to the massive destruction and fragmentation of
natural habitats (Vitousek et al., 1997). This change, along with an
alteration of climatic dynamics, has accelerated the extinction of
several species (Chapin et al., 2000) and caused the endangerment of
many ecological processes (Fearn and Redford, 2008; Wilcove et al.,
1998).
The complexity and increasing fragility of the linked human and
natural system require new types of investigation if we are to be able
to face the challenge of environmental surprises and take into account
legacy effects (Liu et al., 2007).
Despite a tremendous effort to investigate the causes and effects of
this unprecedented impact, especially when it comes to maintaining
the well-being of man (MEA, 2005 a, b) and associated ecosystem
services (Mooney et al., 2009), some processes, like the disruption of
the communication systems between organisms (Carson, 1962;
Harris-Jones, 2009), or chronic anthropogenic noise exposure (Barber
et al., 2009), continue to be poorly understood.

For this reason, given the global threats that we face today, the ﬂux
of information in the communication network should be the primary
component of environmental complexity to be investigated and
monitored.
Of the ecological disciplines in existence, one of the more recent
approaches to deal with this challenge seems to be Acoustic Ecology
(Pijanowski et al., 2011). The focus of this recent area of research is the
study of the soundscape, which is deﬁned as the product of the
relationships between the sounds of the environment and the listener
(Schafer, 1977). The soundscape is thus an important epistemological
tool, because it reﬂects both the physical and informative properties
of environmental acoustic cues and the communication mechanisms
of organisms and different species (Krause, 1987, 2002; Kull, 2010;
Schafer, 1977, 1994).
Such studies are now possible thanks to technological advances in
the quality and efﬁciency of recording devices and the availability of
new metrics and computation tools which can be applied to sound
analysis (Pieretti et al., 2011; Pijanowski et al., in press; Qi et al., 2008;
Sueur et al., 2008; Villanueva-Rivera et al., in press).
At the present time, the application of soundscape analysis could
enable us to efﬁciently investigate the dynamics of animal behavior,
particularly when habitats are modiﬁed, fragmented, or destroyed.
Birds are good bioindicators of such changes (f.i. Furness et al., 1993;
Hill, 1995), and many studies have indeed focused on the monitoring
of bird species' richness and distribution in an attempt to highlight

A. Farina et al. / Ecological Informatics 6 (2011) 354–363

differences in environmental health (Andren, 1994; MacArthur et al.,
1962). The reason for this is the intrinsic characteristics of birds: they
are distributed over a wide range of landscapes; their presence is an
indicator of the state of the structural complexity of the vegetation
(Bradbury et al., 2005; MacArthur and MacArthur, 1961); and, ﬁnally,
they are easy to detect in comparison to other animal groups (Furness
et al., 1993). In addition, we have acquired a good knowledge of the
biology of most bird species over the years, meaning that the results
obtained from monitoring them are both meaningful and able to be
more easily interpreted (Bardeli et al., 2010).
The aim of this contribution is to further illustrate a recently
developed metric, the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), (Pieretti et al.,
2011), in order to investigate the avian soundscape as an indicator of
the informative and communication properties of a bird community.
This is possible because this new tool may quickly highlight changes
in behavior and the composition of a community, both in time and
space.
The effective suitability of this new form of soundscape analysis for
avian monitoring, a detailed explanation of the different, potential
approaches, and the possibility of its applicability to a long-term avian
monitoring scheme in fragile areas are all extensively discussed in this
paper.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area
The study area, which is located on a westerly exposed gentle
slope at 250 masl along the coastal range of the Eastern Liguria Region
(Italy) (44°13′30″ N, 9°30′23″ E), is now covered by a dense, luxuriant
Mediterranean maqui. Until a complete abandonment in the 1950s, it
was previously intensively cultivated, as demonstrated by the
remnants of terraces that are still visible in some parts.
There are no paved roads in the site, and urban development
seems to be a very remote prospect, but the risk of ﬁre is signiﬁcant,
and such a disturbance may well reset the ecological succession at any
time. Indeed, partially burned trunks and scar remnants inside the
actual vegetation prove that the entire area has been ravaged by ﬁre
several times since the abandonment of cultivation.
The perennial vegetation (randomly sampled in a 30 m radius
around the recording station) is composed of Mediterranean scrub, in
which Erica arborea (mean height 1.90 ± 1.00 m, N = 40), Quercus ilex
(2.79 ± 1.02 m, N = 17) and Arbutus unedo (2.71 ± 1.20 m, N = 13)
dominate the shrub layer. Other less abundant species present are
Pinus pinaster, Phillirea latifolia, Cistus spp., Daphne cnidium, Calicotome
spinosa, Mirtus communis, and Calluna vulgaris.
The canopy cover was estimated by way of hemispherical
photography using a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera with a Nikon
FC-E8 0.21x ﬁsheye converter, sampling the vegetation in 57 places
located in a 30 m radius from the recording station. The images
obtained were processed using the Gap Light Analyzer (GLA) (Frazer
et al., 1999). The mean canopy openness results of 22.40% (min 7.87,
max 51.99), SD 7.55, CV 33.72.
For the purpose of the meteorological characterization of the study
area, we refer to the 2010 data bank provided by the meteorological
station in the town of Deiva Marina, which is located at sea level; (http://
www.ilmeteo.it/portale/archivio-meteo/Deiva+Marina/2010). The
mean temperatures over the course of the intra-seasonal intervals in
2010 have respectively been: 20–31 May: 21.25 ± 1.48; 1–11 June:
23.25 ± 2.12; 12–13 June: 21.25 ± 1.35; 24 June–4 July: 26.14 ± 2.54; 5–
15 July: 28.11± 1.16; and 16–26 July: 28.00 ± 1.78.
2.2. Recording techniques
The soundscape of a selected location was recorded for 56 days,
between May 20 and July 26, 2010, from 4.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. CET,

355

using a SongMeter Digital Field Recorder (SM1) (Wildlife Acoustics,
Inc., Massachusetts) programmed to record 1 min every 11 min.
Accordingly, 90 audio-ﬁles were collected each day, amounting to
5040 ﬁles in total, guaranteeing the max acoustic sampling along the
daily interval provided by the SM1 device. The sampling was set at a
frequency of 44,100 Hz, 16 bits, and with a 30% microphone gain.
The Wavesurfer software (Sjölander and Beskow, 2000), powered
by the SoundscapeMeter plug-in (Farina and Piccioli, in prep), was
then utilized to analyze the sound ﬁles. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
of 512 points was used to obtain a matrix of intensity from each audioﬁle for 256 frequency classes (86.13 Hz each) along 5167 temporal
intervals of 0.012 s. This matrix was the starting point of the ACI
analysis.
We decided to only process the spectrogram between 1500 Hz and
15,000 Hz, which amounted to 157 frequency classes. The 15,000 Hz
upper threshold was adopted in order to exclude crepuscular insects.
In order to exclude background noise, we set an a priori ﬁlter which
was appositely veriﬁed for the type of recording used. With the aim of
obtaining an immediate picture of the composition of the bird
community, a non-standardized survey was conducted by one of us
(AF) at a distance of 100 m from the recording point, amounting to a
total of 17 h of direct counting over 13 different days (from May to
June), at a distance of a week, between approximately 6 a.m. and
8 a.m. The complete list of the identiﬁed species is contained in
Table 2. A further aural identiﬁcation of natural- and anthropogenicborn sounds was performed for selected ﬁles, with the aim to couple
the ACI values with individual species acoustic performances or
anthropogenic noise events.
The Surfer v9® was utilized to elaborate on the tri-dimensional
models applying the kriging method of interpolation to ACI
distribution across the day hours and seasons.
3. Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) metrics
The Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) (Farina and Morri, 2008;
Pieretti et al., 2011) has been designed to measure the complexity of
sound spectrograms obtained from a linear scale of sound intensity
and, speciﬁcally, to analyze the bird soundscape.
The ACI measures the absolute difference between two adjacent
values of intensity, Ik − Ik + 1, where k is the kth position in the intensity
values recorded along a single frequency bin (i) and in a single
temporal subset (j) on the original matrix extracted from the
spectrogram. Subsequently, the ratio between this summation and
the total of the sound intensity in j is calculated:
ACIij = ∑nk = 1 Ik −Ik + 1

where n is the number of intensity values (Ik) in temporal interval j
(Fig. 1).
The ACI formula is based on the assumption that biotic sounds,
such as bird or cicada song, have a great variability in intensity
modulation, even in small fractions of time and in a single frequency
bin. Antrophonies (human generated noise) and geophonies (wind,
water ﬂow), however, have more constant intensity values, resulting
in smaller differences between time t and t + 1. In this way, the ACI
extracts the majority of biophonies while reducing or eliminating
(when of low intensity) the non-biotic sounds and the effects of
distance of sound from the microphone. In particular, it has been
stressed that the ACI could be suitable for evaluating bird soundtopes
which are deﬁned by Farina (2011) as an intentional, coordinated
association of different singing birds.
To reduce confusion in the terminology, we deﬁne the following
(the values of this case-study are reported in brackets):

f. Intra-seasonal intervals, every group of days over the course of the
breeding season (11 days);
g. Frequency macro-classes, every group of two or more frequency
classes (1350 Hz).
The ACIij results can be managed in different ways, producing a
variety of types of interesting information which characterizes the
local soundscape. Accordingly, it is possible to carry investigations out
along a temporal and a frequency domain.
3.1. The temporal domain

session:

ð3Þ

which is the sum of the ACIij values along the temporal subsets.
The ACI(session)j can be used to investigate the evolution of the
soundscape over time intervals of the same session when this interval
is consistent, f.i.1 h.

j=1

a. Sound session (ACIij), each programmed recording session over
the course of the day, also reported as a “sound ﬁle” or simply a
session (1 min);
b. Temporal interval (k), the interval at which the ACI metric is
applied (0.012 s);
c. Temporal sub-set (j), the interval of time into which we divide a
sound session (1 s);
d. Daily session, every session a day (totaling 90 sessions);
e. Macro-session, every group of two or more sessions (here 10
sessions);

ð2Þ

ð4Þ

is the sum of the ACIij values along the frequency classes.
The ACI(session)i is the basis for further analyses, especially when
comparisons between different ﬁles are requested or when we intend
to evaluate the trend of the ACI over the course of the day or season for
each frequency class (Fig. 2).
3.1.2. ACI(loc)
The ACI(loc) is the sum of all of the elements of the matrix ACI
(session)hd. This index can be used to compare the acoustic

In order to interpret the daily trend better, we have grouped the
ACI(session)hd into nine macro-sessions (b). These are comprised of
10 sessions each (covering 2 h) and are in six intra-seasonal intervals
(c) of 11–12 days each (20–31 May, 1–11 June, 12–23 June, 24 June–4
July, 5–15 July, and 16–26 July). Due to the lack of some elements in
some groups, the ACI(season)bc is expressed as an average value.

On some days the recordings failed due to technical problems or
unfavorable weather conditions. As a consequence, the ACI(sign_season)
has been calculated as a mean value on the basis of the number (r) of
recording days in each intra-seasonal interval.
The frequency classes have been further merged into 10 frequency
macro-classes of 1350 Hz, while the different daily macro-sessions
were grouped into nine intervals of 10 sessions.

Table 1 sets out all of the variables utilized in the ACI metrics along
with the values used in this case-study.
4. Results
The ACI(loc)d results revealed that the bird community has two
main acoustic peaks, one on about 30 May and a second on 16 June.
Thereafter, a general decrease in the ACI values was noted, and after
July 9 the cicadas' songs dominated the soundscape (Fig. 5).
In order to distinguish bird song activity from that of the cicadas,
we split the ACI(loc)h into two separate periods (May 20–July 8, July
9–26). The ﬁrst portrays a typical bird community shape, with the
majority of activity being early in the morning (dawn chorus) and a
second, less important, chorus taking place at dusk. The onset of the
cicadas' songs on 9 July completely changed this pattern; this insect is
very active from 9 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. (Fig. 6), with an ACI peak at noon.
These two different patterns can be better distinguished using the
ACI(season)bc index, where the ACI values were grouped into nine
macro-sessions and six intra-seasonal periods (Fig. 7, Table 1s).

The bird community was more active during the intra-seasonal
interval, 20–31 May, with there being a slight decrease in activity in
the next three periods and a clear drop in the number of songs
performed in July. This pattern can be easily observed by focusing on
macro-sessions one, two, three and nine (corresponding to about
4.00–10.00 a.m. and 6.00–8.00 p.m.). After 9 July, the situation
suddenly changed, since the bird singing activity was partially
masked by the cicadas' song, which dominates the soundscape from
the second half of the morning until dusk, during macro-sessions four
to eight.
These results are also evident from the 3D representation of the
ACI(session), in which the entire set of sound data obtained by
plotting the value of the ACI for 56 days × 90 daily sessions (Fig. 8) is
represented. In this way, it is possible to observe the dawn and dusk
peaks of activity, the introduction of the cicadas' song in July, and the
presence of some anomalies (spikes) which could be identiﬁed using
the original digital sound archives.
For instance, peak #1 was the result of a helicopter ﬂying at low
altitude, while peak #2 was produced by a gust of wind.

The analysis of the ACI data performed in the frequency domain
enables the acoustic signature for each intra-seasonal period to be
described. The signature produced by the ACI(sign_season)ic (from
May to early July) reveals a repeated pattern with two distinct peaks,
while thereafter there was a multiwave pattern produced by the
cicadas (Fig. 9).
From May to early July, the ﬁrst peak, around frequency classes one
to 12, is higher and narrower than a second peak, which is roughly
located between classes 17 to 35. Moreover, from July 5 to July 26, the
size of the ﬁrst peak is much reduced, while the second peak
disappears completely.

frequency along the six different intra-seasonal periods. Meanwhile, the
ﬁnal four macro-classes are less represented over the study period.

5.1. Some comments on the methods
On the basis of the stated aims of this contribution, we applied the
ACI metric, showing the potentialities, and the manipulations of the
data according to the different temporal frames (hours, days and

intra-seasons) and the long, different groups of frequency bands. This
approach enables us to investigate behavior and community complexity and to obtain answers to some questions relating to the
multifaceted way in which birds interact acoustically.
The choice of recording sessions of 1 min every 11 min seems to be
a good compromise when it comes to obtaining a reasonable sampling
of the daily trend of a soundscape. The evaluation, for the ﬁrst time, of
the SoundscapeMeter-plug-in (Farina and Piccioli, in prep) has
demonstrated in the results herein that this software not only
works efﬁciently, but has also enabled us to extract a great deal of
information from the data. Moreover, the data processed during each
daily session can be easily confronted by listening to the original
sound ﬁles directly. This procedure allowed us to quickly verify
possible anomalies in the data due to events like anthropogenic noise,
strong wind, rain and other meteorological occurrences.
The location of the recording station can make a difference (as
observed in the same areas covered by other nearby recording stations,
Farina in prep), but deﬁnitive evidence that birds intentionally creating
a soundtope (sensu Farina et al., in press) is still lacking.
5.2. Some comments on the results
The study site, herein selected because a typically problematic area
along the coastal range of Mediterranean Europe, has been demonstrated to have a Hi-Fi soundscape (“a Hi-Fi environment is one in which
sounds may be heard clearly without crowding or masking” Schafer,

and daily sessions (90) (x axis). From the image it is possible to note the dawn and dusk
chorus, reduced song activity in the middle of the day, and the presence of some spikes
(anomalies): 1: This peak is the result of a low altitude helicopter ﬂight. 2: The introduction
of the cicadas' song in July when bird activity is much reduced or absent. This picture,
obtained using Surfer9®, is of great interest in a monitoring program because of its
immediate readability and the ability to verify every anomaly or visible trend.

1977, p. 272). This is largely due to the morphology that is typical of a
hanging-valley and its relative remoteness from anthropogenic,
continuous disturbance sources. Due to a secondary succession that is
exposed to vegetation rejuvenation after frequent ﬁres, the study site
continues to be particularly favorable when it comes to investigating the
turnover and dynamics of bird assemblages.
This region is regarded as a hot spot for biodiversity, like other
parts of Mediterranean Europe (Myers et al., 2000), and has long been
shaped by human activity, which has increased the complexity of the
land mosaic (di Castri, 1981) and, as a consequence, affected its
biological diversity (Blondel, 2006; Grove and Rackham, 2001).
Increasing areas of coastal land are today being neglected, and
despite the growth in human well-being, ecosystem services are
rapidly degrading (e.g.Raudsepp-Hearne et al., 2010). In particular,
the neglect of resources has led to the loss of the correspondent
semiotic interfaces (the eco-ﬁelds, sensu Farina and Belgrano, 2006)
that are necessary for their tracking (Farina, 2011).
Furthermore, the ecological fragility of this area also contributes to
its recent colonization by the Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea), a
medium-sized babbler that is native to southeast Asia, southern China
and the Himalayan regions of India and is known to be invasive in
Hawaii (Ralph et al., 1998) and Japan (Amano and Eguchi, 2002a,b;
Dubois, 2007; Eguchi and Amano, 2004).
Recently introduced to northern Italy (Pautasso and Dinetti, 2009),
the Red-billed Leiothrix is now abundant locally (Nardelli, per. com.;
Farina et al., in press), and the study of the population dynamic and
competition effects on other species of birds is a very appealing topic for
further research. Indeed, after a confrontation with aural direct listening
of the recorded ﬁles, this species (easily to be detected in the
spectrograms, song and call produce typical regular ﬁgures) contributes
to the soundscape, particularly in the late breeding season (Fig. 9, July 5–
26, frequency bins 1 to 15) when others, like the Common Blackbird and
European Robin, become silent.
What emerges from the results is the fact that the bird community is
very active in the early morning, after dawn, and at dusk, with a decrease
in song activity over the course of the season. This conﬁrms a wellknown pattern that has also been observed in other bird communities
(Burt and Vehrencamp, 2005; Dabelsteen and Mathevon, 2002;
Kalcenik and Krebs, 1982; Mace, 1987; Staicer et al., 1996). Meanwhile,
Fig. 9 highlights greater daily, acoustic regularity at the beginning of the
breeding season, which is a clear indicator of the non-casual
organization of the soundscape. However, in July, the soundscape
changes abruptly due to the increase in the cicadas' song, which
produces highly variable ACI values. This variability is probably due to
the fact that cicadas produce a broad-band signal with a high degree of
frequency and time heterogeneity. When we observe the ACI value early
in the morning and at dusk, when the cicadas are silent, there is an
expected decreasing trend in terms of bird song activity.
The acoustic signature has at least two distinct patterns: from 20
May to 4 July, the presence of two peaks is the result of the

contemporary song of the Common Blackbird, Red-billed Leiothrix
and European Robin. This changes after that period, when the trend is
less clear and the contributions of warblers like the Dartford Warbler,

Sardinian Warbler and Subalpine Warbler emerge. The acoustic
activity of these warblers is more variable and less important when
it comes to soundscape characterization.

Fig. 10. Distribution of the mean ACI value along the 10 macro-classes of frequency (band 1 = 1500–2850, band 2 = 2851–4200, band 3 = 4201–5550, band 4 = 5551–6900, band
5 = 6901–8250, band 6 = 8251–9600, band 7 = 9601–10,950, band 8 = 10,951–12,300, band 9 = 12,301–13,650, band 10 = 13,651–15,000) and the 10 intra-season periods.

The small peak observed in the ﬁrst frequencies in July is the result
of the acoustic contribution of the Red-billed Leiothrix, which was
previously masked by the acoustic activity of the Common Blackbird
(Fig. 9).
From the analysis of the frequency bands aggregated into macroclasses (Table 2s, Fig. 10), it is evident that the ﬁrst two macro-classes,
from 1500 to 4200 Hz, demonstrate a clear decrease over the course of
the season. Meanwhile, from 4200 to 9600 Hz, the sharp increase in
the last intra-seasonal period is almost certainly due to the cicadas'
activity.
5.3. Some comments on the soundscape approach
As recently discussed by Krause et al. (in press), characterization of
the soundscape can help with the evaluation of the diversity of an
animal assemblage. In their research, Gage and Krause chose four
locations in the Sequoia National Park (California, US) according to their
elevation and vegetation type. They then superimposed the vegetation
signature on to the acoustic signature by extrapolating the soundscape
of other localities with similar vegetation cover. This method opens the
way for an efﬁcient methodology for landscape evaluation, although
some caveats cannot be avoided. Indeed, we have to take into
consideration the fact that the soundscape is a dynamic “object” and
that to collect an acoustic signature in a ﬁne grained mosaic, like the
Mediterranean maqui, requires the positioning of more than one
recording station to ensure the proper characterization of the soundtope
(Pijanowski et al., in press; Krause et al., in press).
Prior to this investigation, information about the soundscape of
this area was completely absent and, for this reason, it is not currently
possible to conduct a comparative analysis. Nevertheless, this study is
a good starting point when it comes to investing in long-term research
and monitoring. Indeed, in the future, we expect that the soundscape
may be modiﬁed by ﬁre events, changes in human impact due to
increased tourist activity, climatic shifts, and the unpredictable
dynamics of the Red-billed Leiothrix population.
The ecological fragility of the study area suggests that this location
is a good candidate for long-term ecological research.
The climatic crisis that the Earth has been experiencing in recent
years (Gitay et al., 2002; McArty, 2001) could be a further element to
take into account when investigating probable changes in biological
rhythms, particularly since birds, like many other organisms, are very
sensitive to climatic parameters and their variability (Crick, 2004;
Peterson, 2003). Accordingly, this changing context may well affect
their acoustic performances in terms of phenology and intensity
where the ACI index seems to be able to detect such variations.
6. Conclusions
Until recently, the processing of sound ﬁles frequently required a
long computation time, discouraging their extensive use in monitoring
schemes. Today, however, the SoundscapeMeter plug-in has proved to

be a tool that is able to process a large amount of sound data in a very
short period of time; for instance, a one minute sound ﬁle is processed in
5 s. This development enables data to be processed in real time,
immediately after its collection from the ﬁeld. Accordingly, it is in this
direction that our efforts to utilize this plug-in for long-term monitoring
activities are oriented.
As a consequence, and as seen in Fig. 8, computation of the ACI
enables us to observe the dynamics and changes that occur in a bird
community over the course of the hours, days and seasons, as well as
also allowing us to verify every anomaly that might occur during an
automatic recording, such as due to anthrophonies (helicopters) or
geophonies (rain, wind gusts).
Producing a soundscape signature (Fig. 9) also means that it is
possible to describe the patterns of sound activity that a local
community produces, while ACI metrics have been demonstrated to
be a powerful tool with which to analyze the complex patterns of a
soundscape. Accordingly, the aim of testing this metric with a view to
later applying it to a routine monitoring scheme seems to have been
achieved.
