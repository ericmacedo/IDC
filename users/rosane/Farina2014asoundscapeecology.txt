Abstract Low cost (audio) recorders (LCRs) represent a new opportunity to investigate the sonic
complexity of both natural and urban ecosystems. LCRs are inexpensive sampling audio
recorders which have the external shape of a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive, and are
composed of a microphone, an analog-to-digital converter, central processing unit with permanent
internal non-volatile memory, rechargeable battery, and a USB connection. The reduced dimensions allow the device to be deployed inconspicuously within any environment, in any configuration and for an extended time period. This investigation tested a specific type of LCR (UR-09)
with a spectral range of 8 kHz - sufficient to cover the acoustic range of most western Palearctic
songbirds. The reliability of the UR-09, compared with other commercial recorders (Zoom H4
and Song Meter SM1) and based on the quality of recordings quantified by the Acoustic
Complexity Index (ACI), was tested and confirmed. An example of the application of LCRs is
presented in an evaluation of the audio patterns occurring during dawn and dusk choruses within a
forested ecosystem. Results of this investigation are encouraging and a new generation of LCR
devices is currently being designed with real-time acoustic data processing capabilities, timer
programmability, a larger frequency range and wireless communication compatibility. LCRs are
revealed to be ideal instruments to conduct surveys in fragile or protected areas and also in urban
environments. Moreover, due to their low cost, they can be used to encourage research in

Introduction
Wherever there is human activity, sounds are generated. The cracking of twigs when walking,
speech, traffic, machinery - all produce sounds that radiate into the surrounding environment.
Such human generated sounds - anthrophonies - combine with the sounds of waterfalls, wind and
other natural sounds - geophonies - and with sounds produced by animals (bird song, the calls of
mammals, and stridulations of insects among others) - biophonies - to form the soundscape or
sonic environment (Pijanowski et al. 2011a, b). The soundscape is not constant; it is both spatially
and temporally heterogeneous. This variation, prevalent in every ecosystem (natural and urban),
can be defined and characterized by specific acoustic signatures (Bormpoudakis et al. 2013).
Soundscape ecology, an emergent field of investigation (Farina 2014) was recently proposed as a new ecological tool applicable to monitoring animal community dynamics
(Pijanowski et al. 2011a, b), measuring the level of biodiversity (Gasc et al. 2013), and
managing the sources of anthropogenic noises (Botteldooren et al. 2006). This discipline is
an innovative approach to investigating the complexity of both human and natural systems,
and is less invasive than traditional physical surveys (Davies 2013).
Biologic systems can be investigated in depth by recording and quantifying acoustic energy
to infer the complexity of unique areas, such as remote tropical regions or neighborhoods
within cities. This technique may also be used to further understand perturbations over the
landscape, such as changes in land use, the effects of climatic changes on animal populations
or simply the quality of coupled human-natural environments (Liu et al. 2007; Pijanowski
et al. 2011a, b). Environmental sounds can be used to assess the degree of biological richness
and ecological integrity of the environment (Gasc et al. 2013). Soundscape analysis is a
powerful approach in investigating the complexity of the signs and codes - that is to say, the
biosemiotic relationships - that vocal animals share to maintain connections with neighboring
individuals (Farina and Pieretti 2013). Hence, the soundscape can be interpreted to glean
information about the environment for every vocal and non-vocal animal (Farina et al. 2011a;
Krause 2012), and the importance of the soundscape was recently extended when Gagliano
et al. (2012a, b) reported that plants react morphologically to different sources of sounds (see
also Francis et al. (2013) for other effects on vegetation). Moreover, the quality of human life is
also affected by the sonic environment where noise pollution levels are commonly accepted as
a parameter in environmental quality assessments (Mace et al. 1999).
The sonic heterogeneity that emerges from the overlap of geophonies, biophonies, and
anthrophonies creates sonic patterns defined by Farina (2014, p. 17) as ‘sonotopes’, which can
be related to distinct behavior-driven variations in the acoustic activities of individual species
(Farina 2014, p.19, Malavasi and Farina 2013). In particular, the sonic quality of fragile and
rare habitats seems to be a fundamental parameter of that habitat, but it is underutilized for
nature conservation (Barber et al. 2011).
Investigating the soundscape requires collection of information on different acoustic
sources - which could be originating from waterfalls, birds, or machinery to give three
examples - that are irregularly distributed across the landscape. The passive recording of environmental sounds is a technique that collects a large amount of data with minimal human intrusion

Urban Ecosyst (2014) 17:923–944

925

(Hobson et al. 2002), requiring the simultaneous deployment of numerous microphones
in arrays or transects to achieve adequate representation of sound sources and to collect
statistically relevant data. An array of recorders regularly spaced in a grid format has
been shown to be a good experimental design (see Farina and Pieretti 2013, Rodriguez
et al. 2013). The line transect method is an established technique in bird census works
(Bibby et al. 1992) and it represents the most expeditious investigation. However,
various other spatial geometries can be utilized. Applying the same approach in soundscape investigations, a linear transect of sound recorders dispersed at regular intervals
can be used to collect information about the distribution of vocal animals, especially
across environmental gradients. The data collected can be analyzed by expert systems at
a later time, thus reducing the amount of effort and uncertainty found in field aural
identification and signal quantification.
In practice, the costs of most modern audio digital recorders (ranging from US$800 to 1000
for each device), the labour required to setup the equipment in the field, and the requirement
for professional bioacousticians to use the equipment and interpret the data means that the
realization of a grid or of a transect using numerous acoustic data loggers is often not possible,
especially in countries where funding can be very limited, or where citizen science approaches
to data collection are adopted.
Recent technological advances have resulted in the availability of low cost audio recorders
(LCRs) (approximately 10 US$ per unit) that have interesting performance capabilities that
could be comparable with the performance of more expensive devices. They are small devices
that can be easily connected to a computer using a USB port, and have a rechargeable internal
battery. The disadvantages are the low quality microphone and a reduced spectral sensibility
(8 kHz) although this range of frequencies covers the majority of birds, frogs, and terrestrial
mammals, but not bats or many insects.
The objectives for this investigation is to test the reliability of the LCR UR-09 and to
compare its performance with two other commercial devices: Zoom H4 (Zoom Inc.) and
Song Meter SM (Wildlife Acoustic ™), which are used by professionals for soundscape
studies both in natural and urban systems. Moreover, in order to evaluate the adequacy of
UR-09 to investigate the acoustic dynamics of vocal animals, an example of an application is presented where acoustic patterns of a bird assemblage at dawn chorus is
compared to an early morning (Fig. 1). The use of LCRs could open a new realm
soundscape research that involves citizen scientists, wildlife managers, rangers, and
professional scientists, in natural and urban ecosystems and in both rich and poor
countries.

Materials and methods
The LCR
This investigation involves the use of a commercial LCR digital audio recorder (model UR-09)
produced by the ShenZhen HNSAT Industrial Co. Ltd (China). The device is similar in shape to
an USB flash drive, has dimensions of 64x22x10 mm, weighs 14 g, and costs around 10 US$
each (Fig. 2). This recorder has a third generation, highly integrated single-chip (ATJ331X,
Actions Semiconductor Co., Ltd, China) and records at a sample rate of 16,000Hz in a
compressed .wav format at 128 bps. Sound is collected by a built-in electret, omni-directional
microphone with an output impedance (F=1 kHz 1 Pa) of 2.2 kΩ, a frequency range of 50 Hz to
8 kHz, a sensitivity (F=1 kHz, 0 dB=1 V Pa) of −42±3 dB, and a signal to noise ratio (F=
1 kHz 1 Pa) A-weighted of 60 dB. The recorder has an internal storage capacity of 8 Gb. The
device is equipped with an internal Li-Polymer rechargeable battery (NAT 401235, 3.7 V 120
mAh 1212) that can be recharged directly by means of a PC via USB or at a powered hub
(Fig. 3). It will record for an average of 16 h and can be extended to 140 h when powered by an
external battery. The microphone gain of LCR cannot be modified.
The recorder operates, according the factory’s description, with Microsoft Windows 7. The
flash memory is formatted according the FAT32 file-system so that generated audio files can
also be read by others platforms like Apple OS, Linux and later versions of Windows. Audio
files are segmented automatically every four hours.
Acoustic complexity index (ACI)
Performance of the UR-09 recorder and a comparison with other commercial devices was
assessed using an Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), which has been used extensively in the
analysis of soundscapes. The ACI is an algorithm created to produce a direct quantification of the
complex biotic songs by computing the variability of the intensities registered in spectograms of
audio-recordings (Pieretti et al. 2011). The ACI was provided by SoundscapeMeter software
(Farina et al. 2012) that is freely available (http://www.disbef.uniurb.it/biomia/soundscapemeter/).
This index has been demonstrated to be a good metric to describe acoustic patterns
and capable of producing a rapid analysis of acoustic data with a limited investment
of time per person (Pieretti et al. 2011).

and processed using this hub

The ACI was parameterized with a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) window of 512 points, a
noise threshold filter of 3000 amplitude, and “clumping” (the temporal window on which to
apply the ACI index along the acoustic file) was set to 1 s intervals. This parameterization was
extended to all the tests for field investigation. Two hundred and fifty six classes of frequencies
were obtained after applying the FFT to the acoustic files (this transforms the .wav file made
by the LCR from a temporal to a frequency domain), each class consisting of a band of
31.25 Hz when the sampling frequency was 16 kHz (LCR, SongMeter SM1), and 86.16 Hz in
the case of Zoom H4, when the sampling was 44.1 kHz.
TEST 1: Recording variability between individual LCRs
Fifty UR-09 LCR devices were purchased directly from the producer (ShenZhen HNSAT
Industrial Co. Ltd, China) and had been previously tested in their inter-individual variability of
recording performances in the Urbino University Scientific Campus Park (43°42’01.18”N
12°38’29.64”E, 321 m a.s.l.) on July 30, 2013 at 6.00 p.m. At that time there were sounds
from birds and cicadas to verify the performance and sensitivity of microphone capsules. All
recorders were synchronized to record natural, ambient soundscape for 5 min. The ACI index
and the energy per unit time falling within a given frequency band (power spectrum) were
calculated for every frequency band to evaluate the performance of each audio recorder.
TEST 2: Comparison between the LCR and two commercial-scale acoustic data loggers
TEST 2a comparison with Zoom H4
Zoom H4 is a commercial recorder with good acoustic outdoor reliability and already
extensively used in our field research to investigate the sonic structure of a bird community
during the breeding period (e.g. Farina and Pieretti 2013). This audio recorder can sample the
sound at one of three frequencies (44.1, 48 and 96 kHz), has an input gain mode that ranges
from −48 to 0 dB, and additionally offers three recording modes (for musical instruments, low
volume musical instruments, and outdoor recordings). This test used a sampling frequency of
44.1 kHz and the microphone was set on the position for outdoor recording mode with a gain
of −12 dB. A comparison between four Zoom H4s and four LCRs was carried out on 31 May,
2013 within four different woodland areas of the northern Apennines (M. Tergagliana
(44°14’56.19”N, 10°05’33.31”E, 625 m a.s.l.), Virolo (44°13’59.98”N, 10°06’01.29” E,

928

349 m a.s.l.), Monte Curto (44°14’01.02”N, 10°04’03.69”E, 222 m a.s.l.), Madonna dei Colli
(44°12’37.85”N, 10°03’27.12”E, 217 m a.s.l.), by error. These sites form part of an ongoing
soundscape research program. The UR-09 recorders were placed in the same container
used to protect Zoom H4 from humidity and rain. On the 31 May 2013, 16 files (one
from each piece of equipment) each of one hour duration were recorded of the dawn
chorus.
Zoom H4 devices have a minimum sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and sound files were resampled in the laboratory at16 kHz in order to compare the value of ACI at the same frequency
classes of the LCR. The ACI was calculated for one hour of dawn chorus by subdividing the
sound files into sections of one minute duration (each one minute division is known as a
temporal step). There were 60 temporal steps analyzed for each device.
TEST 2b: comparison between LCR and Song Meter SM 1
The Song Meter SM 1 (Wildlife Acoustics ™) is a very popular device used world-wide to
collect acoustic information, especially for long term investigations. Several studies have
recently been published using this device (e.g. Sueur et al. 2008, 2012; Farina et al. 2011b;
Pekin et al. 2012; Gasc et al. 2013). A comparison was made between the Song Meter SM1
and the LCR by setting the SM1 gain at +40.5 dB (45 dB max available) with a sampling rate
of 16 kHz. The comparison was carried out in a beech forest of the Tosco-Emiliano Northern
Apennines (Lago Pranda, 44°18’19.99”N, 10°14’39.01”E, 1276 m a.s.l.) from 7.00 to
8.00 a.m. on 24 July 2013. The ACI was calculated for both devices by subsampling one
hour sound files in 60 steps of 1 min each.
TEST 3: LCRs used to describe the dynamics of bird communities
This investigation tested the capability of the LCR to collect acoustic information (that is
to say biophonic information) in a heterogeneous forested location near “Madonna dei
Colli” (44°12’23.87”N, 10°03’38.70”E, 327 m a.s.l.) in the Fivizzano Commune at an
average altitude of 200 m a.s.l. This area has an undulating topography and is particularly rich in bird species diversity due to the high heterogeneity of tree species and
canopy structure. The forested area is at different successional stages after various
logging events and is encompassed by margins of cultivation (e.g. vineyards, olive
orchards, and abandoned fields). Plant species and birds are reported in Supplementary
Materials #1 and #2, respectively.
Forty UR-09 recorders were placed on the lower branches of trees between 3 and 4 m above
the ground at 80 m intervals along a forest path. One device malfunctioned and its data was
excluded from the computation. This interval was chosen taking into account the acoustic
overlap between adjacent recorders in dense vegetation, which creates a real barrier to sound
propagation (Farina and Pieretti 2014). For the morning session, the recorders where placed in
the field on July 2nd, 2013, starting at 5.20 am and the data sampling was for one hour starting
at 7.20 am. The dawn session was conducted on July 16th, 2013. The recorders were placed
along the previous transect and switched on at 17.45 h the day before. The UR-09 LCR lacks a
timer to programming a start time. Data sampling was for 60 min starting at 3.30 a.m., which
was the start of the dawn chorus at this time of the year. Deployment of the recorders along the
3.2 km transect required 90 min on average for both cases. Canopy cover of each recording site
was estimated according to methods of vertical photography proposed Goodenough and
Goodenough (2012). The ACI was calculated for both sessions subdividing the one hour
period in 60 steps of one minute each.

Results and discussion
TEST 1: Reliability of LCR
From a stock of fifty UR-09 recorders used in this test, eight were discarded for an evident
malfunction. The remaining recorders showed similar ACI values (n=42, CV 12.16) along the 256
classes of frequency as indicated from the correlation matrix reported in Table 1. The temporal
distribution of ACI for the 5 min intervals has similar values for all the recorders (Table 2). The
power spectrum calculated for each recorder for the 5 min interval revealed a CV=20.17.
TEST 2a: LCR & Zoom H4
Positive correlations were found between the ACI values for the different recorders along the
60 temporal steps of 1 min each (Table 3). A correlation r>0.80 was found in 12 of the 16
comparisons. Although the acoustic patterns have a similar distribution between Zoom H4 and
the UR-09 LCR, the LCR repeatedly had a higher ACI than that from the Zoom H4. This may
be due to a difference in gain levels between Zoom H4 and the LCR.
TEST 2b: LCR & Song Meter sm1
A significant positive correlation (p<0.05) was found between the SM1 and the LCR for ACI
along frequencies (256 classes) and for the ACI along the 60, 1 min temporal steps (r=0.98 and
0.96, respectively). The total value of ACI is higher for SM1 probably due to the maximum gain
setting. When SM1 is set at +30, similar to a previous investigation (Farina et al. 2011b), the ACI
values are found to be always lower than those for the LCR. The excellent correlation between
LCR and SM1 (Fig. 4) represents a further contribution to confirm the reliability of LCR.
TEST 3: Line transect survey
A comparison between dawn and morning sessions shows a similar acoustic footprint or
signature (Fig. 5) but, as expected, the amount of information at dawn was higher than in the
late morning. Also the shape of the acoustic signature appears more complex at dawn with two
peaks compared to one in the late morning.
A correlation of r=0.99 was found between dawn chorus and morning ACI values, thus
confirming a similar patchy distribution of bird sounds at least during these two periods. From
a cluster of recorders the data from the LCRs at dawn was aggregated according to distinct
temporal patterns. This result confirms the heterogeneous spatial distribution of birds at dawn:
a distribution that is approximately coincident with the roosting places of passerines (Fig. 6a).
Cluster analysis applied to the ACI values of the recordings in the early morning produced less
clear patterns (Fig. 6b).
No significant correlation was found between vegetation cover and ACI values during the
dawn chorus or in the morning (Kruskall-Wallis 7.75 (P=.05), 4.42 (P=0.21) respectively). Of
course, further investigations on vegetation structure are required to adequately explain this result.
Perspectives on the application of LCR to urban soundscape evaluation, protection and design
The methods presented in this study provide an example of sampling techniques that are
advantageous for remote areas or where human impact may be strong. Due to the dimension of
the LCR, it can be easily placed at ground level and attached to shrubby or tree vegetation or

buildings using very simple solutions. The use of low cost recorders can create a new
perspective in nature monitoring with enormous potential benefits for habitat conservation,
rare species detections, and landscape assessment, planning and management. The more LCRs
used in a study, the greater the sensitivity and/or spatial scale that can be covered. The
variability in LCR microphone capsules has minor consequences on ACI calculation because
this index is a normalized measure of the information.
The results obtained by our sampling efforts are very encouraging and there is no doubt that
ecological acoustics has entered into a new area of field research and acoustic monitoring. The LCR
has the potential to be used by a greater number of professional researchers and by citizen scientists.
This applicability provides an opportunity for increasing the area over which LCRs are used and it
is likely that important data sets will be produced and made available for the scientific community.
Nation-wide census schemes could be reshaped and the contribution of non-professional individuals could be more important than in the past. For instance, the application of LCRs may be a useful
tool to estimate population changes of bird communities along roadsides or for direct bird censuses
with real time acoustic data processing. This method could be applied for instance to the North
America Breeding Bird Survey (http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/intro10.html). The use of
LCRs could provide a direct comparison between bird richness and individual abundance and
environmental sounds could be obtained from using small arrays of LCRs.
Some technical improvements are possible, for example equipping LCRs with a very
inexpensive photocell that can switch on the recording only in the presence of light excluding,
for instance, the night time. This application is under experimentation and seems to work very
well. Supplementing the LCR’s power supply with an external battery allows for over five,
24 h days of continuous registration saturating the internal memory of 8 Gb. The LCR could
record for 10 consecutive days if equipped with a photocell.
Some alternative solutions to LCR include smart phones applications suggested by Zhang
et al. (2010), but at the moment it remains an interesting stratagem with high costs of the
hardware and there are issues around leaving such devices outside for a long period of time. A
more sophisticated and ad hoc designed digital recorder with many additional performances
like time setting, data processing in real time and remote capacities by using a Wi-Fi, spatial

localization, low power consumption and a high storage capacity is under experimentation
(Lattanzi and Bogliolo 2012).
The same methodology can also be used to investigate the acoustic events of amphibians,
insects, and mammals. Further, the low cost approach can be extended to freshwater and
marine systems. Costs may be reduced significantly in comparison with the traditional marine
recording methods (submerged data loggers equipped with professional hydrophones).
However, a LCR that can be submerged remains quite expensive when compared with the
terrestrial LCR.
The use of low cost recorders can create a new perspective in nature monitoring with
enormous potential benefits for habitat conservation, rare species detections, and landscape
management. The possibility to deploy a great number of recorders in an easy way and with
very low costs provides new opportunities to sample environmental heterogeneity with great
accuracy and, hence obtain a realistic correlation between acoustic activity of vocal animals,
human activity and various characteristics of the environment. With this approach it will be
possible, as in the case of birds, to investigate acoustic activity outside the breeding period
when this activity is scarce but no less significant than during the breeding season. For
instance, this method could be used to investigate the specific composition and dimension
of mixed flocks of vagrant birds and their spatial distribution.
The urban environment, a real challenge in the integration between humans and nature
(Katti and Warren 2004; McDonald et al. 2008; Gordon et al. 2009) were green belts, parks
and physical refuges like roofs host a great variety of animals (Goddard et al. 2010) with
beneficial effects on biodiversity conservation, is spreading dramatically at the global level
(UNFPA 2007).

In urban areas unwanted sounds are the major cause of sonic pollution, a direct concern for
human health and an important source of citizen dissatisfaction (Skanberg and Ohstrom 2002;
Ohrstrom et al. 2006. In particular due to broad valence (the emotional value) that sounds have
in the urban social context, recording and categorizing sound perception is a complicated
exercise for researchers and policymakers (Kang and Zhang 2010).
Contemporary noise pollution has important effects on biodiversity and directly on vocal
animals (Brumm and Slabbekoorn 2005; Warren et al. 2006; Dowling et al. 2011; Proppe et al.
2013) producing a differentiate distribution of species (Joo et al. 2011) and changes in local
dialects (Luther and Baptista 2010).
Improving the quality of urban soundscape means designing “soundmarks”, like fountains
or sonic sculptures, and also increasing the quiet in urban green spaces and parks. In particular
the preservation or enhancement of the quality of sonic environment of urban parks may have
a double benefit acting on the human well-being (from one side) and on the presence and
abundance of vocal animals. Bird song and water are two sounds preferred by park visitors
identified in a recent study carried out by Yang and Kang (2005) but green belts and tree lines
along the avenues may also represent important source of sonic quality.
The decrease of urban noise and more in general the increase of the quality of the
soundscapes have been proven to have important effects on many species of birds
(Slabbekoorn and Ripmeester 2008). The reduction of noise in an urban park allows the
presence of rare species as recently found by Paton et al. (2012) in Spain and Portugal.
The sonic approach to solve, at least some of the numerous problems that the high energy
consumption, the concentration of technologies, services and people pose in urban environments seems a promising strategy. Urban areas require constant environmental monitoring due
the rapid changes in human fluxes around the urban spaces. The use of cheap, small low cost
audio recorders seems extremely important as a technique for recording and analyzing sounds
in the urban environment. LCRs can be easily distributed and the information collected by
such devices can be coupled with social psychological studies on the perception of the
individual surroundings.
Due to their cheap cost, large numbers of LCRs can be placed across urban settlements
according and even at different heights to collect information about the multilayer sound
sources. The new generation of LCR, that incorporate Wi-Fi facilities will be more efficient for
long-term studies reducing further the cost of manpower necessary to transfer acoustic
information in permanent acoustic database.
Environmental sounds can be used to describe the complexity of several human disturbed
environments in which the complexity of the topography and the heterogeneity of vegetation
prevent the application of standard environmental sampling methodologies. Environmental
sounds can be used as indicators of environmental complexity when other traditional systems
are too expensive or too time consuming. A relatively low technology can solve problems that
would require complex remote sensing technologies. Hence, the application of LCR with
multiple recorders spatially deployed across a (natural or urban) landscape opens the way to
new studies in animal behaviour and ecology, coupling resource availability and real distribution of vocal organisms.
The use of LCRs is a good very low-cost solution when the principal aim is to investigate
the information associated with environmental sounds. This investigation suggests that expensive acoustic recorders can be substituted by low-cost devices with a greater number of devices
in the field. The use of LCRs opens new opportunities to create a sustainable research program
allowing a greater number of people to benefit from this innovative micro-technology. Using
LCR may also allow researchers with limited and low resources to operate. This is especially
the case in developing countries where conservation programs are limited or non-existent. This

emerging technology now offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of environmental
systems. This is an essential step in designing and implementing effective conservation
management programs.
