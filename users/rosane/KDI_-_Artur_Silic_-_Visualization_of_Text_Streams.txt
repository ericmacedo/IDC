I. I NTRODUCTION
From the earliest days of human civilization, visualizations
have been an important way to record, communicate or analyze
real and abstract entities. Over the past two decades, digitalization of textual data has greatly increased the accessibility
of text documents in all areas of human society. This has
introduced a strong need for efficient storage, processing,
retrieval and analysis of texts, since the number of available
documents has become quite large. Visual exploration is an
efficient and natural way to analyze large text collections. This
work presents a survey of methods to visualize text streams.
The article is structured as follows. First, research areas
of wider scope and research areas that interact with text
visualization are discussed in Section 2. Next, data collection
types are structured in Section 3 and visualization process
is explained in Section 4. Evaluation of visualizations is
presented in Section 5 and successful applications are noted
in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the article.
II. R ELATED RESEARCH AREAS
S. Owen defines visualization as ”a tool or method for
interpreting image data fed into a computer and for generating
images from complex multi-dimensional data sets” [1]. Information visualization is a subfield that studies how to visually
represent large collections of non-numeric information [2].
Texts carry information encoded in natural language, hence
text visualization is a subfield of information visualization.
Visual analytics is a closely related area of research which
has been described as ”the science of analytical reasoning
facilitated by interactive visual interfaces” [3]. Information
visualization enables visual analysis which is a subsequent
step in knowledge discovery [4]. The importance of moving
from confirmatory to explorative data analysis is emphasized
in [5], [6]. Integrating automatic analysis and exploratory
analysis with the aid of visualization techniques will enable
more efficient and effective knowledge discovery [5].

Another field of study that relates to text visualization is
Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [7], a DARPA-sponsored
initiative to investigate the state-of-the-art in finding and
following new events in a stream of broadcast news stories.
Pilot phase started in 1998 and final phase of the project ended
in 2004. The developed methods for detection and tracking of
stories are elaborate and data-specific. They can be used as
a background tool for text stream visualization in which case
the foreground drawing methods need not be complex while
the visualizations can still be highly informative. An example
of such method is EventRiver [8].
Analogous to text and data mining methods, text visualization heavily depends on algebraic algorithms and statistical
methods. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection is
employed on matrices that represent text collections. When
representing texts, all sorts of information extraction and processing methods can be employed. These are mostly developed
within the computational linguistics community.
In practice, designers of visualization systems have to be
aware how their visualizations are used and question if user’s
needs are satisfied while performing exploratory or confirmatory analysis. Due to human factor involved in evaluation of
text visualization methods, methodologies from social sciences
are used. Information visualization has common tasks of
interest with empirical research in human-computer interaction, perceptual psychology, and cognitive reasoning. Although
some mutual research has been done, more integration of
these communities is encouraged [9]. At last, visualization
researchers and developers can refer to design principles to
improve readability, interaction and general usability. For such
advice, see E. Tufte’s book [10].
III. DATA T YPES
Visualization methods operate on three types of text data:
1) Collection of texts (col)
2) Single text (single)
3) Short interval of a text stream (flow)
The latter is used to visualize trends in texts arriving in real
time [11], [12], [13]. Such visualizations can be dynamic
meaning that they include animations [11], [13].
Essentially, text streams are characterized as collections
of texts that arrive through time. Let us comprehend the
following: A text collection is composed of documents which
are composed of paragraphs. Finally, paragraphs are broken
down to sentences which are the basic carriers of messages in
a language. If we observe the paragraph sequence of a single

2

text as a sequence of independent texts, we will come to the
conclusion that the former established partition of methods is
superficial and that any text stream method can be used to
visualize a single text (and vice versa).
However, the partition based on collection type is useful
due to the following reasons. First, the statistical properties
of text parts on single text level and on collection level differ
significantly. For example, probabilities of word occurrence in
a single text are noisier so smoothing has to be used, see [14].
Second, computational demands differ since a single text can
be represented within a matter of kilobytes in comparison to
large corpora like the New York Times [15] corpus that contains
more than 1.8 million news articles from a period of over 20
years and has size measured in gigabytes. Even larger corpora
are processed—in [16], a collection of over 90 million texts
is reported.
However, it is useful to present methods at all levels of
text streams since basic concepts are synonymous—to discover
and analyze trends in texts. The relativity in comprehension of
what is a text collection has already been noted in [17], [18].
Recently, some works were published on visualization of
search results, human dialogue, and software code. Although
these are similar data types, such works will not be discussed.
Also, there are some works that relate social network media
analysis and text mining. Discussion about these will be left
for future work.
IV. V ISUALIZATION PROCESS
In general, the visualization is composed of three steps.
First, the texts processed in a representation more suitable
for sequent operations. Second, in order to draw a view, a
mapping onto a 2D or 3D space is performed. Documents,
groups of documents, terms, events, relationships, summaries
or other entities are drawn and labeled on the view. Third, user
interaction is enabled. This process is refined in more detail
in [4].
This section discusses a number of existing methods from
the aspect of visualization process. A brief survey with an
emphasis on historical aspect is available in [4]. A brief, but
well-written review of methods is given as a related work
in [13]. Text visualizations methods in relation to TDT and
temporal text mining are structured in [19]. An extensive
survey of trend detection which includes visualization methods
and commercial products is described in [20]. Also, a comprehensive survey oriented on commercial patent analysis tools
is available in [21].
A. Text representation
Unstructured text is not suitable for visualization, so a text
is usually represented in vector space model (VSM) [22].
This concept is very popular in information retrieval. Bagof-words, an instance of VSM, is the most widely used model
for text representation. The method consists of counting word
occurrences in text. This produces a vector in the space of
features, which correspond to the words found in the text.
Doing so, word order is abandoned. Often, the vectors are

weighted using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
method (TFIDF) [23].
Alternatives to VSM exist—a text can be represented using
a language model where a text is treated as a set of probabilities, for example refer to [24].
Another example of novel approach to text representation is
employed within the MemeTracker framework [16] in which a
collection of documents is represented as a phrase graph. For
this method VSM is not suitable since information on word
order is needed for extraction of phrases from text.
Other information apart from bare words can be extracted
from text. Some relations can be trivial to extract from texts
(e.g. co-occurrence of names in texts) while others are not
expected to be feasible to extract in the foreseeable future
(e.g. author’s stance on some entity not directly written in
the text, obtainable only by precise logic reasoning and background knowledge). However, as research in the computational
linguistics field progresses, information extraction techniques
will be advanced and information visualization will have more
data to feed on. The following list gives methods of feature
extraction that are currently used or are foreseen to be used
in the near future.
1) Bag-of-words—this is a baseline used by many methods.
It can be improved with stop-word filtering, morphological normalization and word sense disambiguation. Apart
from single words, collocations and other significant
word n-grams can be extracted.
2) Entity recognition—these techniques automatically identify names of people, organizations, places, or countries
[25]. Moreover, relationships among entities found in
text can be introduced. Events can be extracted and
visualized, see [8].
3) Summarization—these techniques include keyword extraction, keyword assignment, thematic categorization,
and fact extraction. The aim is to shorten texts and
present only the most relevant information, hence the
visualization is able to filter the clutter even more
effectively. An example of extracted facts visualization
can be found in a commercial product ClearForest [20].
4) Document structure parsing—these relatively simple
techniques are used for automatically identifying structural elements such as title, author names, or publication
date. Structural information can be used in the visualization process as well.
5) Sentiment and affect analysis—these techniques are used
to emotionally characterize the content of texts. An
example of affect visualization for single documents can
be found in [26].
By using these feature extraction methods, relative importance of each feature present in a text is obtained by general
or method-specific means. For example, simple occurrence
frequency is a common numeric value of a feature in the bagof-words model. In contrast, relations among entities can be
the result of a very complex model that involves syntactic
parsing of sentences.

B. Drawing a view
Table I summarizes this subsection by listing existing visualization methods and their underlying methods. The table
also notes publication year and if the method has an inherent
temporal orientation apart from time slicing. It is easily
recognized that methods with inherent temporal orientation
are researched only in recent years.
1) Term trend approach: The most straightforward way to
visualize trends in text streams is to plot frequencies (FP)
of important terms found in texts at a given window of
time. Feature selection is employed to reduce the number
of dimensions and prevent visual occlusion. Feature selection
methods range from simple frequency criteria like in [34], to
more complex statistical measures of feature importance such
as information gain or χ2 [23] used in [48].
The term trend approach is used in [34], [40], [41]. In
MemeTracker [16] trends are plotted by efficiently detecting
memetic phrases what can be regarded as an advanced phrase
selection. EventRiver plots frequencies of documents relating
to certain events. Event labeling can be regarded as a sophisticated term selection.
2) Semantic space approach: In semantic space approach
each part of the view corresponds to some semantic category
found in the text collection. This approach is used by [27],
[28], [29], [17], [18], [31], [32], [33], [35], [36], [37], [38],
[14], [11], [13], [30], [39], [42], [43]. Often, the vectors
representing texts are of high dimensions because textual
features are numerous, so dimensionality reduction techniques
are employed in order to map these vectors to 2D or 3D space.
Used dimensionality reduction techniques include Latent
Semantic Indexing (LSI) [49], Principle Component Analysis
(PCA) [50], and Correspondence Analysis (CA) [51] which are
all methods based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A
very good blog entry on this subject is encouraged for reading
[52]. Before performing these linear algebra operations, a
distance function between vectors has to be defined—often
the Euclidean distance is chosen among others.
PCA method yields the best low-level approximation of
the original term-document matrix with regard to variance
and classification. It tries to preserve as much of the space’s
variance in the remaining dimensions. LSI differs from PCA
in the fact that it applies SVD to the covariance matrix instead
to the original matrix. It is noted that LSI is can automatically
solve problems of synonymy and polysemy in a language.
Using CA, an importance of rows and columns is obtained by
regarding inertias. Also, matrix rows and columns and can be
represented both in the same lower dimensional space enabling
a consistent and symmetric analysis of relations among terms
and documents.
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) [53] is another popular
method to reduce dimensions. MDS attempts to find an
embedding from a set of objects into Rn such that the
defined distances among objects are preserved as much as
possible. Only distances among objects need to be given
and whole problem is solved as an optimization task. The
obtained embedding is non-linear and new dimensions lack
straightforward interpretation. Sammon’s mapping [27] is a
version of MDS.

Since MDS-based and SVD-based methods used on large
text collections can be too computationally demanding, some
tricks are employed. Usually, the transform to the low dimensional space is calculated using a smaller set of vectors which
can be a subset of the original set or centroids produced by
clustering of the original set. These methodologies are similar
to concept indexing [54] or, more generally, to coresets [55].
Examples of such methods are Anchored Least Stress (ALS)
[56], Boeing Text Representation Using Subspace Transformation (TRUST) [33], Least Square Projection (LSP) [57], and
Projection by Clustering (PROJCLUS) [39]. ALS combines
PCA and MDS and makes use of the result of data clustering
in the high dimensional space so that it can handle very large
data sets.
Kohonen’s Self Organizing Maps (SOM) [58] is a neurocomputational algorithm to map high-dimensional data to a
lower dimensional space through a competitive and unsupervised learning process.
Force-Directed Placement (FDP) [59] is an algorithm that
has an analogy in a physical system of masses and springs.
Masses have inertia, so their velocity only changes after a force
has exerted the mass for some time. The forces are a result
of springs between masses being stretched or compressed. By
simulation, the algorithm finds a stable point. FDP algorithms
can be problematic because of their complexity of O(n3 ).
IDMAP [60] is an adapted FDP-based method used to improve
computational complexity. Other general or custom graphdrawing (GD) methods are also used, for examples see [44],
[45], [19].
The TreeMap [61] visualization technique used in [12]
makes use of all available display space, mapping the full
hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner.
The hierarchy among texts can be defined in various ways
starting from simple hierarchical clustering. A similar placement method called rectangle packing is used in [47].
Other specific methods that are used to draw visualizations
include: Wavelet filters used in [18], Hidden Markov Models
(HMM) used in [35], Associative Relation Network (ARN)
used in [30], Voronoi Tessellations used in [36], and Random
Projections used in [32].
Different clustering methods are used in many of the
described methods as an intermediate step with the aim to
convert a large set of texts into a smaller set of elements, to
find groups of texts with specific properties, or to summarize
a number of texts.
For now, most of methods that use semantic space approach
enable trend discovery in text streams by time slicing. The
time slicing method constrains a series of views to a series
of time intervals. By analyzing differences in the views, the
user gains insight into changes in text stream. Time slicing has
explicitly been noted for [17], [31], [33], [13], [12] although
it can be performed with any method since it consists only of
constraining the text set to be visualized. Time slicing has been
criticized for being limited in discovery since human memory
is limited and change blindness is present [8].
An interesting approach to time series visualization is
presented in [43]. Entities are visualized using points that
have an associated time signal. The similarity between time

signals is introduced by the following measures: Euclidean,
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [62], and Compression-based
Dissimilarity Measure (CDM) [63]. The DTW distance is used
for time series with different sizes or distortions in the time
axis. The CDM distance is used to detect structural differences
and only works in long time series. Having defined a distance
between time series, LSP or IDMAP enable to find projections
of points to a low dimensional space.
C. User interaction
User interaction is concerned with the way user generates
the view and how he advances to a next one while gaining
insights into the analyzed data. Usually, approaches to interaction are the following [64]:
1) Brushing and linking—a change in perspective on one
view of the data set affects other views as well. For
example, refer to [65].
2) Panning and zooming—concerns with physically constraining the view in order to enable the user to analyze
more general or more specific part of the visualized
space. This is the most prevalent method of user in-

teraction, by default enabled in most of visualization
methods.
3) Focus-plus-context—enables to enlarge a specific part
of the view while simultaneously shrinking the context,
making distant objects smaller. One example of this
approach is the fisheye view. In contrast to zooming,
focus-plus-context keeps the context visible.
4) Magic lenses—filters that can transform the view of a
visualized object in order to emphasize some other characteristic. For example, in the Galaxies view [17], the
documents can be viewed through magic lens in order to
discover their temporal dimension (all documents from
a certain time interval change their view).
When designing a visualization system, it is common to
combine the afore-mentioned techniques with an option to
select data based on some non-visual parameters. The user
should be able to choose a designated time-interval, thematic
categories, persons involved, or any other available structured
information upon which conditions can be set.
Interaction techniques can be advanced in the sense that
animations are enabled. For now, animation has been used in

5

methods oriented on current stream change. In [11], the user
can select a term and the visualization animates to make the
selected term a central point in the view. Next, in [13] the
visualization dynamically changes in real time as texts arrive.
V. E VALUATION
Design of evaluation methods and methodologies for information visualizations is still an ongoing effort of the research
community. All difficulties concerning visualization evaluation
are related to human factor that is inherently involved in the
process of using a visualization. Evaluation is hard since not all
variables can be observed and controlled, in contrast to purely
computational processes. A suggested approach to evaluation
methodology has an inspiration in social sciences [66]. This
section is a brief summary of a recent overview on this topic
written as a book chapter by S. Carpendale [9].
Evaluation is important since the users and researchers need
to compare and validate visualization methods. In the past,
usability of a visualization was only emphasized without systematic research since an easily understandable visualization
speaks for itself. As this field developed, a plethora of methods
has been created so an empirical approach was needed. At
the present, the methods are usually evaluated by university
students on small data sets and oriented towards simple tasks.
Such evaluations are easy to conduct. In contrast to current
practice, the evaluations should be done by real users on real
data sets and oriented towards real tasks. When choosing such
realistic settings, it might be more difficult to obtain large
enough sample sizes, to control all variables or to get precise
measurements.
Many of the challenges in information visualization are
common to empirical research. Related empirical research
disciplines include: human-computer interaction, perceptual
psychology, and cognitive reasoning. The main challenge is
how to address the insight that occurs within the user of a visualization. Such categories highly depend on the participants’
interest, motivation, prior knowledge, and mental capabilities.
There are three important factors of evaluation methodologies:
1) Generalizability—can the results be extended to a wider
scope of users or data sets?
2) Precision—to which extent can the measurements be
trusted?
3) Realism—can the result be considered realistic from the
aspect of the context it was studied in?
As discussed in [66], evaluation methodologies in social sciences can be structured in the following instances: laboratory
experiment, experimental simulation, field experiment, field
study, computer simulation, formal theory, sample survey, and
judgment study. Existing methodologies enable the actualization of one or at most two of the given factors what suggests
that more than one methodology is preferable to be used.
Evaluation methodology can be quantitative or qualitative.
Quantitative methodology has evolved through centuries of
experimental research. The data used in within the quantitative
approach is expressed using numbers. The challenges in front
of this methodology are: conclusion validity, type I and II

errors, internal validity, construct validity, external validity,
and ecological validity.
The data used within the qualitative approach is expressed
in natural language. The techniques can be categorized as:
1) Observation techniques—the participants’ behavior is
observed and described.
2) Interview techniques—the participants give answers to
a set of questions.
The challenges for qualitative methods are: sample size, subjectivity, analysis. The analysis of qualitative methods can be
quantitative or qualitative.
Evaluation of information visualization is still a work in
progress. It is a labor-intensive task since human work is
evaluated and little automatization can be employed. A number
of researchers point out the problem of evaluation and some
of them encourage others for more evaluation methodologies
to be presented in the future works.
VI. A PPLICATIONS
Text stream visualization has a wide range of applications:
in all situations where texts have a time stamp or where the
collections are not static. In the works cited in this report,
various successful applications are mentioned. Those include
analyzing news texts, scientific publications, institutional documents, company filings, patent claims, private and enterprise
correspondence, web content, and historical archives. The
intended users of text visualization suites are media analysts,
historians and other scientists from all fields, public policy
makers, intelligence officers, journalists, business managers,
and private users.
In the future we can expect more applications of text
visualization on the task of social media analysis. Also, apart
from task-specific and data-specific applications, general applications are being developed. An example of such a general
suite is Microsoft’s Pivot Project [67] which aims to enable
seamless information visualization and interaction.
VII. C ONCLUSION
This work presented a general survey of text visualization methods. Related areas of research areas are presented.
Notable works are listed and their methods are discussed.
Suggested approaches to evaluation are structured and a wide
scope of applications and users is noted.
This field of study has a great potential since the volume of digitally available texts has become huge. Advanced
applications are expected to arise from using cutting-edge
information extraction techniques developed within the computational linguistics community. Technical advances might
include novel methods or solving scalability issues. Applicative advances might include integration with collaborative
visualization methods. In order to even better establish these
methods and their implementations, more efforts need to be
invested in research and deployment of evaluation methodologies. Cognitive and psychological aspects need to be included
in the research.
