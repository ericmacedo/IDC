Summary
1. Many organisms depend on sound for communication, predator/prey detection and navigation. The acoustic
environment can therefore play an important role in ecosystem dynamics and evolution. A growing number of
studies are documenting acoustic habitats and their inﬂuences on animal development, behaviour, physiology
and spatial ecology, which has led to increasing demand for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) expertise in the
life sciences. However, as yet, there has been no synthesis of data processing methods for acoustic habitat monitoring, which presents an unnecessary obstacle to would-be PAM analysts.
2. Here, we review the signal processing techniques needed to produce calibrated measurements of terrestrial
and aquatic acoustic habitats. We include a supplemental tutorial and template computer codes in MATLAB and R,
which give detailed guidance on how to produce calibrated spectrograms and statistical analyses of sound levels.
Key metrics and terminology for the characterisation of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic sound are covered,
and their application to relevant monitoring scenarios is illustrated through example data sets. To inform study
design and hardware selection, we also include an up-to-date overview of terrestrial and aquatic PAM instruments.
3. Monitoring of acoustic habitats at large spatiotemporal scales is becoming possible through recent advances
in PAM technology. This will enhance our understanding of the role of sound in the spatial ecology of acoustically sensitive species and inform spatial planning to mitigate the rising inﬂuence of anthropogenic noise in these
ecosystems. As we demonstrate in this work, progress in these areas will depend upon the application of consistent and appropriate PAM methodologies.

Introduction
The increasing sophistication of passive acoustic monitoring
(PAM) – the recording of sound in a habitat – has led to new
insights in the study of acoustically sensitive organisms over a
wide range of spatial and temporal scales (Van Parijs et al.
2009; Blumstein et al. 2011). Such studies point towards the
fundamental role of sound for many species and ecosystems,
mediating processes as diverse as predator–prey interactions
(Remage-Healey, Nowacek & Bass 2006), larval settlement
(Simpson et al. 2005) and coordinated behaviour (Boinski &
Campbell 1995).
The acoustical backdrop to these phenomena is by no means
a silent world: the evolution of acoustic signalling has taken
place in the context of a varying natural background (Wiley &

Richards 1978; Brumm & Slabbekoorn 2005) to which organisms adapt their acoustic behaviour (Morton 1975). This background sound is generated by weather processes (wind, rain,
thunder), seismic events and competing biotic sound (Hildebrand 2009; Pijanowski et al. 2011). However, since the advent
of large-scale industrialisation, acoustic habitats have become
increasingly disrupted by anthropogenic noise. On land, these
sources include road, rail and air transport, and industrial
activity (Barber, Crooks & Fristrup 2010), while underwater,
shipping, oﬀshore construction, oil and gas exploration, and
sonar operations contribute to the soundscape (Payne & Webb
1971; Hildebrand 2009). In both domains, this noise can mask
acoustic cues (Brumm & Slabbekoorn 2005; Clark et al. 2009)
and elicit behavioural responses (Sun & Narins 2005; Nowacek
et al. 2007), with the potential to cause chronic physiological
stress (Rolland et al. 2012; Francis & Barber 2013) and wider
eﬀects on populations (National Research Council 2005) and
communities (Francis, Ortega & Cruz 2009). Awareness of

these human impacts has brought renewed urgency to the
study of acoustic habitats and their inﬂuences on ecosystem
processes (Francis & Barber 2013).
The rapid expansion of this ﬁeld has been driven by major
advances in PAM technology and has led to growing demand
for acoustics expertise in the life sciences. Over the past two
decades, the development of cost-eﬀective autonomous recording units has revolutionised bioacoustics in both air (Mennill
et al. 2012; Digby et al. 2013) and underwater (Sousa-Lima
et al. 2013). Marine bioacoustics has been particularly driven
by technological innovation, with new perspectives oﬀered by
non-invasive recording tags (Burgess et al. 1998; Johnson &
Tyack 2003), autonomous gliders (Rudnick, Davis & Eriksen
2004; Baumgartner & Fratantoni 2008), drifting platforms
(Wilson, Benjamins & Elliott 2013) and region-scale cabled
ocean observatories (Favali, Beranzoli & de Santis 2015).
However, there is currently a lack of clear guidance on how
to analyse PAM data to produce calibrated measurements.
Calibrated data provide absolute measures of biotic, abiotic
and anthropogenic sound levels, which are necessary to draw
meaningful comparisons of habitats through time and at different locations. Here, we seek to address this deﬁcit through a
user-friendly guide to the methods that underpin the study of
acoustic habitats. We detail the signal processing steps
required to produce absolute measurements of sound pressure
and demonstrate the use of analytical techniques to describe
variability and trends in sound levels and to characterise discrete acoustic events. In doing so, we emphasise the considerable overlap in acoustic analysis methods in air and
underwater, and the potential for both terrestrial and aquatic
bioacoustics to beneﬁt from greater integration and knowledge
exchange.

Monitoring platforms
Technology has shaped the development of bioacoustics.
Advances in instrumentation, data storage capacity and data
analysis capabilities have opened up new avenues of research
while enriching established areas. To help contextualise historical constraints on data collection and inform the design of
future habitat monitoring programs, this section brieﬂy summarises the capabilities and limitations of the main types of
PAM platform. We ﬁrst consider ﬁxed platforms – those
designed to be deployed at one location for days or longer –
and then mobile platforms – those that record while in motion
or are portable and deployed for short periods.
FIXED PLATFORMS

The recent expansion in the study of acoustic habitats has been
facilitated by the development of autonomous acoustic recorders: self-contained digital instruments that can be ﬁxed to terrestrial structures or moored to the seaﬂoor to record the
soundscape continuously on the scale of months (Mennill
et al. 2012; Sousa-Lima et al. 2013; see Table 1 for a selection
of commercially available devices). These are generally more
cost-eﬀective and easier to deploy than cabled systems and can

be positioned in arrays to investigate spatial characteristics of
acoustic habitats and to localise and track sound sources (Van
Parijs et al. 2009; Blumstein et al. 2011). Each unit consists of
battery-powered electronics for digital data acquisition and
storage within a weather- or waterproof housing. The acoustic
transducer (microphone or hydrophone) may be mounted on
the device or attached via a cable. Deployment longevity is limited by power consumption and data storage capacity, both of
which continue to improve as the technology evolves (SousaLima et al. 2013). Supplementing the inbuilt power supply
with an external source (solar panel or additional battery) or
duty cycling the ‘on time’ can increase longevity. Habitat monitoring can continue indeﬁnitely if recorders are regularly serviced to replenish batteries and data storage, and systems are
also being developed for remote data retrieval over wireless
communication networks (e.g. Wildlife Acoustics Song
Stream; SMRU Marine PAMBuoy). Seaﬂoor-mounted systems can be recovered using acoustic release devices, although
acoustic release malfunction and trawling by ﬁshing vessels are
common ﬁeld hazards (Dudzinski et al. 2011). Theft and vandalism are also potential concerns (Clarin et al. 2013), as well
as damage from wildlife and biofouling.
Cabled systems have long been used to monitor underwater
sound (Wenz 1961) and consist of seaﬂoor-mounted hydrophones connected to shore stations providing power and data
acquisition. In recent years, cable-mounted systems have seen
a resurgence with the expansion of cabled ocean observatories,
for example the NEPTUNE, VENUS and RSN networks in
the North-east Paciﬁc (Favali, Beranzoli & de Santis 2015).
The capacity for real-time acoustic monitoring and the less frequent servicing required (compared to autonomous units) are
the principal advantages of cabled systems, although the associated costs of deployment, maintenance and management of
these long-term devices and the large volumes of data they generate are correspondingly high.
MOBILE PLATFORMS

In air, a convenient and portable tool for acoustic habitat monitoring is the commercial sound level meter, which makes calibrated measurements of sound pressure level (SPL; Table 2;
Appendix S1, Eqn 17). However, many sound level meters
apply standardised ﬁlters known as A- and C-weightings,
which modify the signal to approximate the frequency
response of human hearing (Kinsler et al. 1999). It is therefore
important to consider whether the frequency range of interest
coincides with human audibility (which it may, e.g. Brumm
2004) and whether a human frequency-weighted metric is
appropriate. Some sound level meters have an unweighted setting (known as Z-weighting, ﬂat or linear), but are still limited
to the nominal frequency range of human hearing.
These limitations of the sound level meter can be avoided by
instead making calibrated sound level measurements using
portable or autonomous ﬁeld recorders. This has long been
standard practice in aquatic bioacoustics (Au & Hastings
2008), where portable ﬁeld recorders are used to record data
from a hydrophone lowered over the side of a drifting vessel.

Unlike data from sound level meters, ﬁeld recordings also
enable post hoc analyses to identify components of the acoustic
environment or to produce other acoustical metrics. Calibrating
the recordings requires knowledge of the relevant hardware
speciﬁcations and an understanding of the signal processing
steps required for the calibration procedure (Appendix S1,
Section 3). Although such calibrated measurements of terrestrial acoustic habitats have been made (Waser & Brown 1986),
these are the exception: habitat monitoring studies more commonly report relative (i.e. uncalibrated) sound spectra (Boinski
& Campbell 1995), sometimes supplemented by measurements
made with sound level meters (Lengagne & Slater 2002).
Portable ﬁeld recorders are well suited to short-term surveys
in favourable weather conditions. A battery-powered digital
audio recorder can be rapidly deployed with a microphone
mounted on a hand-held boom or tripod, lashed to vegetation,
or with a hydrophone lowered to a desired depth in the water.
Care should be taken to minimise incidental noise from the
presence of the monitoring platform and noise generated by
ﬂow of air or water past the acoustic sensor (known as ﬂow
noise or ‘pseudonoise’).
Other mobile platforms have largely been developed for
marine bioacoustics applications. For example, to study marine mammal behaviour, acoustic tags have been developed
which are temporarily attached to animals via suction cups,
recording sound and tracking movement for up to several days
(Burgess et al. 1998; Johnson & Tyack 2003). While these
devices have been eﬀective in studying vocalisations in cetaceans (Johnson et al. 2004) and exposure to high-amplitude
anthropogenic noise (DeRuiter et al. 2013), the ability to
record lower-amplitude low-frequency sound is limited: the
movement of the animal through the water causes turbulence
around the hydrophone, producing ﬂow noise which contaminates low frequencies (Johnson & Tyack 2003), and acoustic
time series are periodically disrupted by surfacing events
(Fig. 1) and vocalisations of the host animal. Application of

1

similar recording tags to terrestrial wildlife has thus far been
limited to one study of wild mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus;
Lynch et al. 2013). Emerging mobile platforms also include
autonomous underwater gliders (Rudnick, Davis & Eriksen
2004; Baumgartner & Fratantoni 2008), which can be
deployed for up to several hundred days, and freely drifting
platforms (Wilson, Benjamins & Elliott 2013), which minimise
ﬂow noise in high tidal ﬂow environments by moving with the
current.
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

The ability of PAM systems to accurately record sound is limited by several factors: dynamic range, frequency range and
system self-noise. The dynamic range is the ratio of the highest
to the lowest amplitude that can be measured by a given system
and can be scaled to higher or lower amplitudes by adding gain
to the signal (within the limitations of the device’s own selfnoise; Johnson, Partan & Hurst 2013; Merchant et al. 2013). If
the gain is too low, quieter sounds may not be recorded (Rempel et al. 2013), and if it is too high, loud sounds can saturate
the system, leading to distortion of the signal through clipping
(Madsen & Wahlberg 2007; Fristrup & Mennitt 2012). A
PAM system should be chosen whose frequency range encompasses the spectral content of all sounds of interest to the study.
This range is limited to half the sampling rate of the recordings
(the Nyquist frequency), and by the sensitivity of the transducer and any ﬁltering in the recording system (Appendix S1;
Madsen & Wahlberg 2007). System self-noise is noise generated by the recording system and acoustic transducer and can
limit the ability of a system to record low-amplitude sound
(Fristrup & Mennitt 2012; Johnson, Partan & Hurst 2013). It
is therefore important to consider self-noise speciﬁcations
when selecting a PAM system, and where possible to measure
self-noise levels by making recordings in a quiet location isolated from sources of vibration.

2005. Sampling rate: 96 kHz. Note the periodic surfacing events (three in total) and the increase in ﬂow noise before and after these surfacing events
caused by increased travel speed.

A wider consideration is that many species (e.g. many ﬁsh,
insect and arthropod species) primarily sense sound not
through sound pressure, but through particle motion, a directional property of the sound ﬁeld (Hawkins 1981; Stumpner &
von Helversen 2001). The devices described above do not
directly measure particle motion, which may be signiﬁcant in
the region near to sound sources (the near ﬁeld) or close to
reﬂecting surfaces, where variations in sound pressure and particle motion can diﬀer considerably (far from the source and
surfaces – in the far ﬁeld – sound pressure and particle motion
are directly related). Although many studies have measured
auditory sensitivity to particle motion in controlled experiments, the use of particle motion sensors in habitat monitoring
is still in its infancy.

Data analysis
There is no standard or widely available software for the production of calibrated PAM measurements. While there are several options for annotation, detection and classiﬁcation of
bioacoustic signals [e.g. Raven (Charif, Clark & Fristrup
2004), PAMGuard (Gillespie et al. 2009)], these operations do
not demand absolute measures of sound level and so typically
use relative levels of signal amplitude. Calibrated measurements require hardware-speciﬁc data (the microphone or hydrophone sensitivity and properties of the data acquisition
system), and many research groups use custom-developed programs for PAM analysis tailored to their equipment. In the
accompanying tutorial (Appendix S1), we present a detailed
guide to the signal processing steps required to produce calibrated PAM data in terrestrial and aquatic environments,
including PAMGuide (Data S1), a template code provided in
MATLAB and R versions which implements the equations presented in the tutorial. Here, we present a non-technical outline
of the calibration procedure and a description of key acoustical
metrics. Application of these metrics to the characterisation of
acoustic habitats is illustrated in the following section.
The basic principle of making absolute sound pressure measurements is to reverse the transformations made to the signal
along its path into the data acquisition system (Fig. 2). The
same steps apply to in-air and underwater PAM devices, which
employ the same fundamental components: (i) an acoustic
transducer (microphone or hydrophone) to convert the sound
pressure into a voltage signal; (ii) a pre-ampliﬁer, which is used
to increase the amplitude of the voltage signal before it is
recorded and may apply frequency equalisation and anti-alias-

ing ﬁlters; and (iii) an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC),
which digitises the analogue voltage signal and then packages
the data as audio ﬁles with a standardised amplitude range (Au
& Hastings 2008; e.g. a 16-bit recording has an amplitude
range of 216 1 bits, i.e. integers between 32 768 and
32 767). To retrieve the original measurement of sound pressure from the audio ﬁles, it is therefore necessary to know: (i)
the sensitivity of the acoustic transducer, which deﬁnes how
much voltage is generated per unit of sound pressure; (ii) the
amount of voltage gain (if any) applied by the pre-ampliﬁer;
and (iii) the ADC input voltage which corresponds to the maximum amplitude that can be represented in the audio ﬁles
(Robinson, Lepper & Hazelwood 2014). This process is summarised in Fig. 2. Alternatively, an ‘end-to-end’ calibration
can be carried out by inputting a known signal into the transducer, for example with a pistonphone (Appendix S1, Section
3). It is important to note that the transducer sensitivity and
the gain of the pre-ampliﬁer may vary signiﬁcantly with frequency, in which case frequency-dependent corrections should
be applied to the signal.
This procedure yields the relationship between the recorded
signal and the signal at the transducer, allowing the sound
pressure signal (known as the pressure waveform) to be computed from the recordings. The pressure waveform is used to
measure the amplitudes of impulsive sounds, such as echolocation calls or gunshots (see next section). Acoustic habitat characterisation generally requires further analysis of the pressure
waveform, such as transformation into the frequency domain
to analyse frequency characteristics and averaging to represent
longer periods (Appendix S1). The output of these analyses is
typically one of a number of common acoustical metrics shown
in Table 2.
Broadband sound pressure level (SPL) is the most ubiquitous acoustic metric and expresses the root-mean-square
(RMS) sound amplitude within a given time window and
frequency range as a single decibel (dB) level, for example
64 dB re 20 lPa (Kinsler et al. 1999). Most acoustical metrics are expressed as a decibel level relative to a reference
pressure, pref, in the form X dB re pref. In air, pref is 20
lPa, which corresponds to the nominal threshold of human
hearing at 1 kHz, while in underwater, pref is 1 lPa. Spectra
showing how sound level varies with frequency are given by
the power spectral density (PSD), which describes the power
in the equivalent of 1-Hz bands in the frequency domain
(although the actual frequency resolution may be much
coarser than 1 Hz), or by fractional octave analysis

(typically 1/3-octave band levels, TOLs), which measures
the power in frequency bands that widen exponentially with
increasing frequency and are evenly spaced on a logarithmic
frequency axis (Fig. 3c). Finally, the sound exposure level
(SEL) is a summation of sound energy through time over a
speciﬁed duration and is often used to assess cumulative
exposure to noise.
An emerging area of study is the use of acoustic indices as
proxy indicators of biodiversity and species composition (Towsey, Parsons & Sueur 2014). Various new statistical indices
(e.g. acoustic diversity index, acoustic complexity index) have
been applied in comparative studies of distinct habitats for this
purpose, so far with mixed results (Lellouch et al. 2014; Towsey, Parsons & Sueur 2014). It remains to be seen to what
extent such techniques will complement ﬁeld observations of
biodiversity and automatic detection and classiﬁcation of species via PAM.

Habitat characterisation
Acoustic habitats can be described by statistical analysis of
sound levels and by time-series representations. Based on the
metrics outlined above and deﬁned in Appendix S1, this section illustrates how these techniques can be used eﬀectively for
various habitat monitoring applications. In general, statistical
analyses are more suited to characterising variability and comparing acoustic habitats at diﬀering times or locations, while
discrete events and trends in sound levels are better described
by time series.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

There are several ways to calculate the average sound level
from a series of shorter measurements, each of which has
particular advantages. The most common metric is the

6 N. D. Merchant et al.
RMS level (see Fig. 3), which is the mean of the squared
sound pressure computed before it is converted to dB
(Appendix S1, Eqn 18). The RMS level is the most prevalent averaging metric, perhaps due to the historic centrality
of Leq in terrestrial noise characterisation (Leq is the equivalent RMS level during a speciﬁed period, which correlates
with human noise disturbance), and its direct relation to
SPL, which makes it independent of the length of the time
segments used in the original analysis (unlike other averaging metrics; Merchant et al. 2012). However, the RMS level
is also strongly inﬂuenced by the highest sound levels (it
can be >95th percentile in some cases; Merchant et al.
2013) and so should be used with caution if applied to
recordings with intermittent high-amplitude events (e.g. pile
driving; Madsen 2005).
Alternative averages can give more statistically representative measures of sound levels than the RMS level. The mode,
deﬁned as the sound level corresponding to the maximum
probability density at each frequency, is (by deﬁnition) the
most representative metric, although few studies have made
use of it (e.g. Parks, Urazghildiiev & Clark 2009; Merchant
et al. 2012) and there is the potential for multimodality to produce misleading results (Fig. 3a; Merchant, et al. 2012, 2013).
Median sound levels (Fig. 3d; known as L50 in terrestrial noise
assessment) can also be used as an indicator of typical sound
levels in a habitat (e.g. Klinck et al. 2012). These are more
robust than the mode and are generally insensitive to limitations in the dynamic range of the recording instrument.
The range of sound levels in a habitat can be assessed by
plotting the percentile levels across the frequency spectrum
(Fig. 3a; Richardson et al. 1995; Castellote, Clark & Lammers
2012). These are alternatively known as exceedance levels,
although the percentiles are reversed, for example the 95% exceedance level, L95, is equivalent to the 5th percentile. Percentiles provide an approximate indication of the distribution of
sound levels and may be useful in characterising the potential
extent of acoustic masking for a particular species (Clark et al.
2009). A more comprehensive analysis of the sound level distribution is given by the spectral probability density (SPD; Merchant et al. 2013), whereby the empirical probability density of
sound levels in each frequency band is presented (Fig. 3a). This
shows the modal structure and outlying data in the underlying
distribution, which helps to interpret averages and percentiles.
It can also reveal limitations in the recording system: for example, in the SPD shown in Fig. 3a, the self-noise of the instrument appears to limit recording of the lowest sound levels in
the habitat above c. 100 Hz, evidenced by the ﬂattening gradient of the lowest data points and their convergence with the
mode above this frequency.
Other statistical analyses include average levels for particular temporal periods to examine cyclical trends, such as diel,
seasonal or annual variability (see Fig. 3c, although other conﬁgurations are also used, e.g. Radford et al. 2008), and boxand-whisker plots (Fig. 3d; Bassett et al. 2012) showing the
spread of quartiles in each band.
In the frequency domain, ﬁne-scale variations in the sound
spectrum can be assessed using the PSD, which is often com-

puted at 1-Hz resolution (Fig. 3b), although this can be computationally demanding when processing and storing large
data sets. Frequency resolution can be reduced using either
coarser PSDs or fractional octave analysis, most commonly in
1/3-octave bands (Appendix S1, Eqns 13–16), wherein the frequency range of the band is directly proportional to the centre
frequency (constant Q). For some taxa (e.g. mammals), constant Q frequency bands are a particularly useful tool for
acoustic habitat analysis, as they can approximate the response
of the auditory system. It is important to note that the spectral
slope of the fractional octave band levels diﬀers from the PSD
(Fig. 3b), as the bands are scaled logarithmically with frequency (i.e. they widen with increasing frequency), meaning
that higher frequency bands integrate energy over larger frequency ranges. For this reason, spectra with diﬀering frequency bandwidths (e.g. PSD and 1/3-octave) cannot be
directly compared.
TIME SERIES

Time series are used to characterise discrete events, such as
vocal behaviour or anthropogenic noise events (typically in the
form of spectrograms), and to track temporal trends in sound
levels, usually in particular frequency bands (e.g. TOLs or
broadband level).
A widely used time-series plot is the spectrogram, which
comprises a series of PSD measurements showing how the
sound level varies with time at each frequency (Fig. 4a). Sound
sources can then be identiﬁed by visual inspection and by listening to the sound ﬁles (depending on the frequency range),
or by automatic detection and classiﬁcation. The time and

frequency resolution of the spectrograms must be suﬃciently
high to resolve the sound events under consideration, and overlapping time windows may be used to smooth data in the time
domain and to ensure sounds at the boundary between time
windows are represented (Appendix S1, Section 4).
As well as describing discrete events, time series are used to
track trends in sound levels in particular frequency bands
(Fig. 4b), often in the context of long-term anthropogenic
noise studies (e.g. Miksis-Olds, Bradley & Niu 2013).
While the amplitudes of nominally continuous sounds (e.g.
tonal vocalisations, ships, wind-generated sound) can be accurately represented in frequency spectra, this is not the case for
impulsive sounds (e.g. echolocation calls, snapping shrimp,
gunshots, seismic airguns, pile driving; Fig. 5a). If impulsive
sounds are identiﬁed, their amplitudes should instead be measured using the pressure waveform (Fig. 5b), which gives a
much ﬁner time resolution with which to measure the impulse
amplitude (Madsen 2005). The peak amplitude of the pulse is
described by either the peak-to-peak (SPLp p) or zero-to-peak
pressure (SPL0 p), as illustrated in Fig. 5b (Appendix S1,
Eqns 22–23). A further metric, sound exposure level (SEL)
describes the acoustic energy contained in the pulse (Appendix S1, Eqns 24–25). The duration of the pulse is commonly
deﬁned by the 90% energy envelope: the time window between
5% and 95% of the cumulative acoustic energy (Blackwell,
Lawson & Williams 2004; Fig. 5c). To accurately measure
acoustic pulses, a recording system should be chosen whose
sensitivity does not vary signiﬁcantly within the peak frequency

The temporal range of acoustic monitoring has been greatly
increased by advances in instrumentation and data analysis.
Looking forward, the emerging area of acoustic habitat mapping promises in turn to expand the spatial scope of monitoring studies. Integrating PAM data with spatial models has the
potential to produce ground-truthed sound maps of acoustic
habitats (Barber et al. 2011; Erbe, MacGillivray & Williams
2012; NOAA 2012; Mennitt, Sherrill & Fristrup 2014), which
with large-scale monitoring could extend to the regional and
national scales relevant to ecosystem-scale assessment (Barber
et al. 2011; Mennitt, Sherrill & Fristrup 2014) and the migratory ranges of wide-ranging species (NOAA 2012). If such
maps are suﬃciently predictive of sound levels, they could help
to highlight areas of concern for anthropogenic noise impact
when overlain with animal distributions, and oﬀer new perspectives on the spatial ecology of acoustically sensitive species.
Large-scale mapping inevitably involves pooling measurements made by many groups, potentially using diﬀerent
devices; thus, the success of these modelling eﬀorts will depend
in part on the quality and standardisation of passive acoustic
measurements they are based on. We hope that the overview of
methods presented here contributes to a robust methodological foundation for this progress and helps to make passive
acoustic techniques more accessible to newcomers to the ﬁeld.
