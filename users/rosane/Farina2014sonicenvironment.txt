Herein we present one of the ﬁrst attempts to couple the complexity of vegetation and topographic features with
the sonic environment to understand the distribution of bird species and individuals in their habitat. To achieve
this, the sonic features of a bird community were studied during the spring and early summer of 2011 in a Mediterranean maqui located on the western slope of a remote hanging valley that is dominated by Erica arborea,
Quercus ilex and Arbutus unedo.
Species composition, height, vertical foliage proﬁle, canopy density and dispersion of vegetation were utilized as
probable proxies for the sonic patterns. The acoustic activity of birds was collected through the use of a regular
matrix of 20 audio recorders, spaced 25 m apart, which were placed following the topographic isoclines. The
sonic complexity of the soundscape was evaluated using the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), which is a recently
developed metric.
The PCA applied to the vegetation parameters revealed two principal distinguishing factors, which we were able
to deﬁne as “vegetation density and structure” and “species segregation.” Moreover, the results show that, even
in the case of sampling sites that are very close together, sonic patterns vary across the season, highlighting the
great variability of the soundscape and conﬁrming the adequacy of the sampling scale of 25 m adopted in this
study. The topographic features do not seem to be connected to the sonic environment. The main sonic complexity was found where the vegetation was taller and denser, especially where E. arborea was the dominant species.
Although this proves that acoustic dynamics can be linked to vegetation structure, even on a small scale, a consistent element of sonic variability cannot be explained by vegetation patterns alone, and a soundtope hypothesis
must be invoked.

1. Introduction
The recent ﬁeld of soundscape ecology (Farina et al., 2011a;
Pijanowski et al., 2011a,b; Truax and Barrett, 2011) has revealed new
perspectives when it comes to investigating the sonic complexity of
the environment, which is an important component of the quality of
ecosystems. This has produced a powerful and efﬁcient tool to be used
for both the short- and long-term monitoring of biological and ecological dynamics (Bardeli et al., 2010; Depraetere et al., 2012).
The acoustic diversity of biophonies (Krause, 2012, p. 68) has been
regarded as an indirect estimator with which to evaluate the biodiversity of different habitats (Gasc et al., 2013; Sueur et al., 2008).
Investigations of the sonic complexity of the environment are
considered to be useful when it comes to: understanding the relationship between the structure of vegetation and animal dynamics (Pekin
et al., 2012); evaluating the complexity of animal assemblages (Gasc
et al., 2013); and investigating the relationship between the structure
of the landscape and sonic patterns (Bormpoudakis et al., 2013).

In particular, the biophonic components of the sonic environment
provide important information about community diversity and the
dynamics of vocal animals (Krause, 2012), as well as more generally
about the “health” of ecosystems (Carson, 1962). The acquisition of
such knowledge is ﬁnally possible today thanks to: the use of autonomous recording systems (Blumstein et al., 2011); a powerful methodology with which to process sonic data (Farina et al., 2012); the
availability of new sonic indices (Farina et al., 2011b; Sueur et al.,
2012; Villanueva-Rivera and Pijanowski, 2012); and automatic identiﬁcation algorithms for some groups of species (f.i. Ranjard and Ross,
2008; Skowronski and Harris, 2006; Somervuo et al., 2006; Trifa et al.,
2008).
Despite the great potential of the soundscape approach, there are very
few studies on terrestrial ecosystems in the literature (f.i. Bormpoudakis
et al., 2013; Cellis-Murillo et al., 2009; Joo et al., 2011; Mazaris et al., 2009;
Pieretti and Farina, 2013; Slabbekoorn, 2004). Moreover, uncertainty
persists with respect to ﬁeld procedures, such as: the selection of types
and numbers of recording devices or their calibration (but see Mennill
and Fristrup, 2012); the selection of the spatial and temporal scales
with which to collect the sonic information according to the habitat investigated (Mennill et al., 2006); and the best indices and software

A. Farina, N. Pieretti / Ecological Informatics 21 (2014) 120–132

with which to efﬁciently process the sonic data (Farina, 2014, p. 242;
Gasc, 2012).
For instance, the choice of one recorder versus an array of recorders is a controversial argument that requires empirical validation, as the few examples of the use of arrays have been used to
gauge the best spatial localization of individuals (f.i. Blumstein
et al., 2011; Mennill et al., 2006) and not to intercept sonic patterns
across a large area.
Moreover, most of the literature regarding the relationships between vocal animals (in particular birds) is based on aural identiﬁcation
carried out during ﬁeld surveys. This is an approach that is strongly affected by the skill of the observer and inﬂuenced by the disturbance created by observer intrusion (Bibby et al., 1992, p. 24; Gibbons et al., 1996,
p. 245).
The soundscape approach has the advantage of allowing the researcher to collect information that will be permanently stored in a digital medium. Moreover, the data are processed automatically, and the
aural identiﬁcation can be repeated whenever necessary, reducing the
likelihood of disagreements between people with different species
identiﬁcation skills (Hobson et al., 2002). Finally, human disturbance
is strictly limited to the period of the placement of the recording
devices.
Of course, the relationship between vegetation complexity and the
complexity of the sonic environment has only been investigated infrequently, especially from a bioacoustical perspective. In this context,
Morton (1975) was one of ﬁrst authors to emphasize the importance
of vegetation structure on the acoustic adaptation of birds. His approach
was followed by Marten and Marler (1977), who conﬁrmed the acoustic
adaptation hypothesis, while Laiolo et al. (2008) discussed the role of
landscape fragmentation for the maintenance of a differentiated song
repertoire in the Dupont's Lark (Chersophilus duponti). Later, fragmentation was demonstrated by Briefer et al. (2010) to be an important
process that inﬂuences the composition of elements in skylark songs, although the number and complexity of these elements seem to be more
ﬁxed. Krause et al. (2011), meanwhile, have investigated the complexity
of the sonic patterns in four habitats in the Sequoia National Park (US),
and Pekin et al. (2012) put the emphasis on the relationship between
the acoustic diversity and the structure of vegetation by using a LIDAR
approach.
There is evidence that vegetation structure affects sound propagation, and the denser the vegetation is, the more the biophonies are
degraded by reverberation and attenuation by leaves and branches
(f.i. Embleton, 1963; Padgham, 2004). This produces responses with
respect to, for instance, the range capacity of territorial birds, as proved
by Morton et al. (1986) and Morton (1987) with respect to Carolina
wrens.
In addition, the topographic characters of the environment are rarely
considered in terms of the relationship with the sonic environment. For
instance, Hunter (1989) has observed that singing birds on steep slopes
are generally oriented towards the up-slope direction, with an evident
advantage for the diffusion of acoustic waves.
Recently, the relationship between the structure of the landscape and
the soundscape patterns has been explained by three different models,
the ﬁrst of which considers a patterned distribution of acoustic cues or
sonotopes, deﬁned as the result of the overlapping of the geophonies,
biophonies and anthrophonies that are coincident with the structure of
the landscape (Farina, 2014, p 17). A second model assumes that the
sonotopes are broader than the landscape patterns due to an expected
active diffusion of sonic cues that go beyond the borders of the vegetation patches. Finally, a third model states that the sonotopes, as described
in the previous model, have an internal spatial variability due to the behavioral dynamics of vocal animals, where competition and cooperation
mechanisms produce the spatial repartition of individuals (Farina and
Pieretti, 2012; Malavasi and Farina, 2013). This further subdivision
would create soundtopes, deﬁned as a coordinated aggregation of
biophonic sounds (sensu Farina, 2014, p 19; Farina et al., 2011a) inside

121

each sonotope. Soundtopes represent distinct and emerging sonic aggregations with a great temporal variability.
In particular, our principal aims were:
• To test different ﬁeld methodologies for collecting information on
vegetation structure.
• To verify the efﬁcacy of: a tight spatial scale while carrying out sonic
investigations in a Mediterranean maqui characterized by dense
vegetation in the ﬁrst 3–4 m of the soil; the application of an array design for placing recording devices.
• To collect the sonic environment characters in general and, in particular, to compare the complexity of the habitats (topography and
vegetation).
• To use such results as a basis for a further discussion of the
sonotope/soundtope hypothesis.
2. Study area
The study area (Fig. 1), which is 600 m from the Tyrrhenian Sea and
stands at an elevation of 300 m, is westerly exposed on the left side of a
small hanging valley, with slopes characterized by an inclination of
approximately 26°. It is located close to the small town of Deiva Marina,
Eastern Liguria, Italy (44°13′27.6″N, 9°30′30.1″E), at the center of a large
secondary dense sclerophyll forest dominated by small trees and Erica
arborea, Quercus ilex and Arbutus unedo shrubs. The area, which is well
away from permanent human settlements and paved roads, is bordered
by some paths that are utilized by tourists from late spring to early fall,
and occasionally by hunters in fall and early winter.
The area, which was partially terraced and cultivated until the early
1950s, experienced recurrent wild ﬁres (1980s; see also Solans Vila,
2007) that have interrupted the wood recovery and intervened over
the course of the process of land abandonment, as testiﬁed by the remnants of old scars along the entire study area.
As a result of a previous investigation of the soundscape of this area
based on a recording station operating continuously during 2011
(Farina et al., 2013), we are aware that the major contribution to the
sonic environment is represented by bird vocalizations and geophonic
sources (wind, rain, thunder). Due to the area's remoteness from
human settlements, the few anthrophonic disturbances are mainly produced by the engines of ﬁshing and tourist boats, military and rescue
helicopters, and civilian aircraft.
3. Methods
Vegetation sampling and sonic recordings were carried out according to a grid of 20 points (4 × 5) regularly spaced at 25 m, covering
an area of 175 × 125 m.
In order to test the potential effects of topographic features on
the sonic environment, it was decided to divide the analysis of the
matrix into ﬁve “vertical lines” (following the maximum slope)
and four “horizontal lines” (following isocline lines; Fig. 2).
3.1. Vegetation sampling
According to the different sampling techniques proposed for temperate deciduous forests (Blondel and Cuvillier, 1977; Blondel et al.,
1973; MacArthur and Horn, 1964; MacArthur and MacArthur, 1961)
and Mediterranean scrubs (Cody and Walter, 1976), we tried to detect
the complexity of the vegetation by collecting information about the
following parameters:
3.1.1. Vegetation height
The height of the shrubs and trees was assessed by direct measures
along two perpendicular transects, each of which was: 8 m-long, centered on each recording station, and oriented according to slope
inclination. The details of the height of the vegetation were collected

122

by erecting a metric road every 2 m along the transects and identifying
each plant species found (see Fig. 2).
For the successive computations, the heights of the vegetation,
expressed in meters, were then resumed for each recording point, indicating only the mean height of the species. This revealed which species
were dominant for the entire area.
3.1.2. Foliage proﬁle
A foliage proﬁle was collected every 2 m along a horizontal transect
of 12 m centered at each recording station. The stations (1, 6, 11, 16 and
5, 10, 15, 20) located in the extreme vertical lines were sampled only on
the internal side of the matrix, and so along a transect of 6 m. A woody

board, which was 3.5 cm wide and 4 m tall and painted red and white
every 20 cm (Fig. 2), was used to estimate the presence of vegetation
at a distance of approximately b10 cm from the board. This totaled
212 counts. The parameters were distinct according to the dominant
plants in three main categories: entire proﬁle [(mean) board cover],
the lower 2 m [(mean) board cover b 2 m] and the higher 2 m
[(mean) board cover N2 m].
3.1.3. Canopy density and dispersion
The canopy density and dispersion were measured using digital images of vegetation according to the method, partially modiﬁed,
described by Goodenough and Goodenough (2012). A Coolpix 990

photo camera, pointed vertically and equipped with a Nikkor 8–24 mm
lens zoom, was utilized to take photos of the vegetation strata at soil
height (low stratum) and at a height of 140 cm (high stratum; Fig. 3).
In order to keep the visual angle of the focal lens constant, it was reduced by a factor of 2 × for the shots obtained at soil height. Shots
were taken in precisely the place where the digital recorders were located, and were repeated six times every 2 m for each of the four cardinal
directions, totaling 25 images at the low stratum (b140 cm) and 25 at
the high stratum (N 140 cm) for each recording station. A total of 1000
images were obtained across the entire study area.
This method has some advantages, as argued by Goodenough and
Goodenough (2012), if compared with, for instance, hemispherical
photography (see for instance Rich, 1990) or other intercept methods
(f.i. Blondel and Cuvillier, 1977; Blondel et al., 1973; Mueller-Dombois
and Ellenberg, 1974, p. 84).
To calculate canopy density and dispersion, monochrome pictures of
640 × 480 pixels were converted into dark and light pixels (representing
respectively the canopy and the sky) using the CanopyDig® software
proposed by Goodenough and Goodenough (2012). The transformation
of a monochrome image into a false color image (blue = vegetation
and red = sky) was carried out by choosing between eight images at different threshold values.
The level of the dispersion of the vegetation was calculated by applying the Morisita index of dispersion (Morisita, 1959, 1962) after
subdividing each image into 12 sub-images and calculating the number
of pixels in each of them using the CanopyDig software according to the
procedure suggested by Goodenough and Goodenough (2012).
In more detail, the Morisita index of dispersion is calculated according to the following equation:

where n = the total number of sub-pictures

the number of the canopy pixels in each sub-picture i
the total number of canopy pixels in the entire image.

This index, which has as its most important property its independence from N, tends to increase with the rise in large gaps in an image.
The Morisita index of dispersion is a robust measure of spatial distribution that is particularly applied to evaluate the dispersion of plants
(for an example of the application of this index, see Myers, 1978;
Nieder et al., 2000).
3.1.4. Shrub and tree species composition
Shrub and tree species were annotated during the canopy density
measurement process and totaled 1000 samplings, of which 500 were
for the low stratum (b140 cm) and 500 for the high stratum (N140 cm).
3.2. Methods of recording and processing the sonic environment
The sonic environment was recorded by using 20 audio recording
devices (Zoom H4™, Zoom Inc., Japan, System 2.40) during spring and
early summer 2011 at the following sessions: 22 February; 6,11,19
and 26 March; 1,8,16,26, and 29 April; 7,13,21, and 28 May; 3,11 and
18 June; 7 and 19 July. The audio recorders were deployed immediately
after that the skylight threshold was sufﬁcient to work under the dense
vegetation cover. For this technical reason, it was not possible to collect
dawn chorus but just the singing activity of the following hours.
Due to the unfavorable (rainy or/and windy) weather conditions,
the data collected on 22 February, 16 and 26 April, 3 and 18 June, and
19 July were excluded from the analysis, since the biological sounds
risked being masked by rain or wind noise, which probably caused a signiﬁcant depression in bird acoustic activity or might alter the acoustic
signature of the community.
The matrix of recorders was oriented along the slope, with ﬁve recorders being placed in four horizontal lines (Fig 2). This orientation,
which is coincident with the orientation of the transects utilized to
check the vegetation, was used later for the interpretation and discussion of the distribution of the sonic patterns and topographic features.
Sounds were sampled at 44,100 Hz at a resolution of 16 bits and stored
on 2 GB Secure Digital Cards.
The sound ﬁles were synchronized by a post-hoc procedure, and all
of the recordings were 120 minute long. The sound analysis was performed using the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) (Pieretti et al., 2011)

where Ik and I(k + 1) are two adjacent values of spectral amplitude in a
single frequency bin.
The ACI values were obtained by sound data processed by the
SoundscapeMeter (Farina et al., 2012), which is a plug-in of the
WaveSurfer software (Sjölander, 2002; Sjölander and Beskow, 2000).
Frequencies higher than 10 kHz were excluded from the analysis, because they were considered to be not representative of the sonic activity
of the bird assemblage investigated. An amplitude threshold value
greater than 3000 was adopted to exclude most of the background
noise. The sound ﬁles were analyzed at a temporal interval of 1 min, enabling us to obtain 120 sub-ﬁles of one minute each for each recording
station. The ACI was set at a “clumping” resolution of 1 sec (86 data,
each at a temporal distance of 0.011 s), totaling 7200 ACI values for
each 120 minute session and per recording station.
Once the FFT was settled at 512 points (Hamming windowing, no
overlap), the ACI was calculated for each of the 116 classes of frequency
(each of 86.20 Hz) in the selected frequency interval of 0–10 kHz. The
ACI values were then assigned at an interval of 1 kHz each, creating
10 ACI categories (Fq: [1, 2 … 10] kHz). It was also decided to further
split the ACI results into two main groups: 0–1 kHz and 1–10 kHz,
which corresponded respectively to background noise (light wind,

124

A. Farina, N. Pieretti / Ecological Informatics 21 (2014) 120–132

sounds of moving foliage, boats, etc.) and biophonic contributions
(mainly birds).
Finally, the ACI index for each recording station was used with
the following temporal scale: ACI total = all daily sessions and frequencies combined; ACI monthly (all frequencies combined) for
each month = ACIFebruary (1), ACIMarch (4), ACIApril (5), ACIMay (4),
ACIJune (3), and ACIJuly (2). The numbers in the brackets are the number of recording sessions per month.
3.3. Statistical analysis
All of the statistical tests were performed using Statistica v.8.0
(StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK). A non-parametric approach was used, since
the variables could not ﬁt into a normal distribution pattern, even
after logarithmic transformation. The Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance was used to test the signiﬁcance between multiple independent
groups for vegetation along the lines and the columns of the grid. The
same statistical analyses were performed for the ACI results, also
looking at the differences among days, months and stations.
The Spearman-rho correlation was used to measure the statistical
dependence between the parameters of the vegetation and the ACI
values.
A Cluster Analysis was performed to classify vegetation data and ACI
frequencies by categories using the Euclidean distance and the Ward
method. The Mann–Whitney U Test was then used to compare the signiﬁcant differences between the independent groups highlighted by the
results of the Cluster Analyses and for comparing vegetation parameters. This test was also used to assess the signiﬁcance of the correlations
(in terms of ACI values) between the adjacent and the ﬁrst non-adjacent
recording point in order to verify the appropriateness of the spatial
scale. This was performed after the exclusion of the March and July sessions to reduce variability due to the migratory habits of some species.
Finally, the vegetation variables were oriented using a Principal Component Analysis.
The Surfer9™ (Golden Software, Inc., Golden, Colorado) was
adopted to create interpolated maps (Kriging method) to give the spatial orientation of the ACI results. Factor 1 resulting from the PCA analysis of the vegetation was also plotted on an interpolation map.
4. Results
4.1. Vegetation
4.1.1. Composition of the vegetation
Table 1 reports the absolute frequency of the species, revealing that
E. arborea is the most common followed by Q. ilex and A. unedo.
Other common species counted were Smilax aspera, Myrtus
communis, Calycotome spinosa and Pinus pinaster.
4.1.2. Height of the vegetation
A. unedo was the tallest species (3.75 ± 0.76 m), followed by Q. ilex
(3.32 ± 0.94 m) and E. arborea (3.07 ± 0.57 m) (see Table 2 for the
mean heights found at each sampling station).
In Table 2 the values obtained by processing all of the 17 variables
are summarized.
The height of the vegetation revealed signiﬁcant differences for
E. arborea (Kruskal–Wallis: H = 11.17, p b .01) and Q. ilex (Kruskal–
Wallis: H = 8.85, p = .03) when the stations were grouped according
to the horizontal lines, but not for A. unedo (Kruskal–Wallis: H = 7.39,
p = .06). The two central lines presented signiﬁcant differences for
E. arborea (Mann–Whitney: U = 22, p = .008) and A. unedo (Mann–
Whitney: U = 22, p = .03), but not for Q. ilex (Mann–Whitney:
U = 29, p = .11). The second line had the maximum difference (signiﬁcant) when compared with the three others: E. arborea (Mann–Whitney:
U = 1, p.01), A. unedo (Mann–Whitney: U = 10, p b .01), and Q. ilex

(Mann–Whitney: U = 4, p b 01). No signiﬁcant differences were found
when the heights were compared for the stations along the vertical lines.
4.1.3. Vertical foliage proﬁle
A different distribution of foliage proﬁles between the three dominant species was evident in the results (see Fig. 4). In particular, the
foliage proﬁle of E. arborea had a maximum of around 140 cm, while
Q. ilex has a quite irregular foliage proﬁle, with maximum values ranging from 40 to 180 cm. The foliage proﬁle of A. unedo, meanwhile, has
a minimum of 180 cm and then increases to 400 cm.
The spatial distribution of the foliage proﬁle according to a gradient
from the downslope to the upslope only had a signiﬁcant difference for
A. unedo when the horizontal lines are considered (Kruskal–Wallis:
H = 8.92, p = .03). The second line in particular is signiﬁcantly different from the others (Mann–Whitney: U = 11.5, p = .02). A slope effect
is not evident for Q. ilex (Mann–Whitney: U = 32.5, p = .67), as is also
the case for E. arborea (Mann–Whitney: U = 26.5, p = .34).
4.1.4. Canopy density
The canopy density presents a signiﬁcant difference between the
four horizontal lines (high stratum, Mann–Whitney: H = 10.62,
p b .01; low stratum, Mann–Whitney: H = 11.34, p b .01). No signiﬁcant differences were observed between the ﬁve different vertical
lines (low stratum, Mann–Whitney H = 1.61, p = .80; high stratum,
Mann–Whitney: H = 4.58, p = .33).
The two central rows reveal signiﬁcant differences when compared
with the ﬁrst and last lines (low stratum, Mann–Whitney: U = 7,
p b .001; high stratum, Mann–Whitney: U = 8, p b .001). When compared with all of the other lines, horizontal line n. 3 maintains a signiﬁcant difference only for the high (Mann–Whitney: U = 6, p b .005), but
not for the low, stratum (Mann–Whitney: U = 18, p b .08) of the vegetation. Horizontal line n. 2 also maintains a signiﬁcant difference for
the low (Mann–Whitney: U = 14, p = .04), but not for the high, stratum (Mann–Whitney: U = 27, p = .35).
A positive correlation exists between the low stratum of the canopy
density and the high stratum (Spearman rho: r = 0.81, p b .01).
4.1.5. Morisita index of heterogeneity
The Morisita index of the low stratum was signiﬁcant when the two
central lines are compared with lines 1 and 4 (Mann–Whitney U = 20,
p = .023), but there are no signiﬁcant differences for the high stratum
(Mann–Whitney U = 31, p = .159). Line n. 2 shows a signiﬁcant difference for the Morisita high strata (Mann–Whitney U = 10, p b .01),
but not for the low stratum (Mann–Whitney U = 31, p = .57). Finally,
line n. 3 is signiﬁcantly different from all of the others for the low strata
(Mann–Whitney U = 14, p = .04) but not for the high stratum
(Mann–Whitney U = 29, p = .45). No differences were found when
the Morisita index was tested with respect to the vertical lines.
The Morisita index of the low stratum is not signiﬁcantly correlated
with the high stratum (Spearman-rho r = 0.21, ns).
4.2. The PC analysis of the vegetation variables
Two principal factors explained 62.34% of the variance (respectively:
Factor 1 = 40.89%, Factor 2 = 1.45%) among all of the vegetation variables considered. On the basis of the orientation of the variables (Fig. 5)
and the position of the recording stations (Fig. 6) on the PCA plot, we
were able to interpret these two factors respectively as “vegetation
structure” and “species composition.” Speciﬁcally, the vegetation discriminates according to Factor 1 in terms of canopy height and density,
with an increase in homogeneity from left to right (Fig. 9a).
The Cluster Analyses (see Fig. 7) showed that the structure of the
vegetation can be distinguished into two main groups: the ﬁrst group
(A) is characterized by more vegetation (tallest plants and highest canopy cover) and the second (B) by less vegetation (shortest plants and
lowest canopy cover).

According to Table 1, station n. 10 on the extreme left of the plot
(Fig. 6) is characterized by very low canopy cover and a low height for
each species. On the opposite side, station n. 1 is characterized by the
highest canopy density and by the greatest height for E. arborea,
A. unedo and Q. ilex.
Factor 2 probably discriminates for species composition, where
E. arborea occupies the upper and Q. ilex and A. unedo the lowest positions. Station n. 15, for instance, is characterized only by the presence
of E. arborea; in contrast, stations n. 18 and n. 3 are characterized by

low numbers of E. arborea and the presence of Q. ilex (station n. 18)
and A. unedo (station n. 3).

The ACI values detailed for each session and every station are reported in Fig. 8, and the interpolated spatial distribution of the total ACI is set
out in Fig. 9b. Table 3 contains the ACI values for the frequency categories and months. The spatial distribution of the ACI for every session and

for each recording station is available in the Supplementary materials
(SM1). The acoustic footprint, intended as the distribution of frequencies after the exclusion of the ﬁrst seven bins (602 Hz), which were
principally attributed to the geophonies and anthrophonies and
regarded as background noise, is summarized for each station (see Supplementary materials, SM2).
A Cluster Analysis of how the frequency categories are distributed in
the different recording stations is represented in Fig. 10, where
four groups are distinct: the ﬁrst group is represented by background
noise (Fq: 1 kHz), the second by rare frequencies (Fq: 2 kHz and Fq:

10 kHz), the third by intermediate values (Fq: 6 kHz Fq: 7 kHz, Fq:
8 kHz and Fq: 9 kHz) and the fourth by the highest ACI values
(Fq: 3 kHz, Fq: 4 kHz and Fq: 5 kHz; mainly attributed to three
songbirds (Turdus merula, Erithacus rubecula and Leiothrix lutea)
by one of us, AF, and following a previous investigation, Farina
et al., 2013).
The background noise levels (Fq: 1 kHz) varied signiﬁcantly during
the different sessions (Kruskal–Wallis: H = 119.31, p b .01). In particular, they were generally higher in the ﬁrst half of the season (March and
April; Kruskal–Wallis: H = 7.69, p = .01), and were differently distributed along the months (lower in March, May and July; Kruskal–Wallis:
H = 62.46, p b .01). A signiﬁcantly different distribution among the 20
stations was also observed for this frequency band (Kruskal–Wallis:
H = 118.26, p b .01), as was also the case when the stations were
grouped according to the horizontal (Kruskal–Wallis: H = 69.72,
p b .01) or vertical (Kruskal–Wallis: H = 17.25, p b .01) lines. In particular, the higher two horizontal lines were less “noisy” than the lower
ones, while along the vertical lines, 1 and 3 were the quietest.
The ACI values of each of the 10 frequency intervals were signiﬁcantly
different along the 14 recording sessions (Kruskal–Wallis: H = 134.52,
p b .01), but were preferentially distributed in the late part of the season
(Kruskal–Wallis: H = 45.05, p b .01), demonstrating the typical trend of
a bird breeding community: ascendant from March to May and descendent thereafter (Kruskal–Wallis H = 102.66, p b .01), with a peak of
singing activity in April, May and June. When looking at the different
placement of the stations, there was a precise difference between them
(Kruskal–Wallis: H = 68.53, p b .01), as well as along the horizontal
(with a very low third line, Kruskal–Wallis: H = 16.69, p b .01) and vertical lines (indicating a high ﬁrst and low second vertical line, Kruskal–
Wallis: H = 13.29, p b .01).
When focused on the central breeding months (April, May and June),
Fq: 1 kHz was signiﬁcantly different because of a very low value in May
(Kruskal–Wallis: H = 49.05, p b .01), while in the Fq: 2–10 kHz frequency interval, the values were more similar (Kruskal–Wallis:
H = 7.71, p b .02).
Both noise (Fq: 1 kHz) and biophony (Fq: 2–10 kHz) levels were
signiﬁcantly different along the ﬁve months of recordings.
Along the season, the comparisons between the ACI of the horizontal adjacent stations and the ﬁrst horizontal non-adjacent stations were not signiﬁcant (Mann–Whitney: U = 99.50, p = .41),
as was also the case between the vertical adjacent stations and the
ﬁrst vertical non-adjacent stations (Mann–Whitney: U = 39.50,
p = .17).

4.4. ACI and vegetation variables
The relationship between vegetation variables and the ACI at different aggregation levels is represented in Table 4. When considering the
sum of all the ACI frequency categories (ACI Total) and the vegetation
variables, no signiﬁcant correlation is observable. Likewise, no signiﬁcant
correlation between vegetation variables was found for ACIFq: 1 kHz and
ACIFq: 2–10 kHz.
Among the variables used to describe the structure of the vegetation,
Height_Au was the variable with the most signiﬁcant relationships with
the ACI aggregations (nine signiﬁcant relationships), followed by Ea
(ﬁve cases) and Height_Ea (ﬁve cases). Au_L and Qi had no cases that
were correlated with ACI aggregations.
Among the 10 categories of ACI_frequencies, the categories that
were more related to the vegetation resulted ACIFq: 10 kHz (9), followed
by ACIFq: 9 kHz (6). ACIFq: 8 kHz, ACIFq: 1 kHz, and ACIFq: 4, 5, 6 kHz had no
signiﬁcant relationships with the vegetation variables. ACIFq: 2, 3, 8 kHz
had an intermediate number of relationships with the variables (2, 1
and 3 respectively).

Fig. 7. The sampling stations clustered according to the vegetation variables.

According to the PCA and the two separate groups of vegetation variables (A and B), the ACI tends to be higher in the stations where the
structure of the vegetation is denser and where there is the presence
of E. arborea (Group A).
The ACI values, according the different categories of frequencies,
were not signiﬁcantly different between A and B. Only ACIFq: 9 kHz
(Mann–Whitney: U = 22, p b .04) and ACIFq: 10 kHz (Mann–Whitney:
U = 12, p b .005) revealed a signiﬁcant difference.
The ACI values of each category of frequencies averaged for all of the
stations were always higher in Group A but in May, the ACI was similar
in the two groups (Table 3).
5. Discussion
5.1. Methodological aspects
The ﬁeld procedure to place an array of recording devices has demonstrated great potential when it comes to obtaining synchronized information about the acoustic activity of birds (biophonies) and
describing the variability of the sonic context assigned to geophonies
and anthrophonies. The “array method” enables sonic patterns along
the seasons to be described and relationships with vegetation patterns
to be ascertained.
According to the aims of this investigation, the scale at which we
have conducted the ﬁeld survey (25 m) was conﬁrmed as an adaptable resolution to ascertain both vegetation and sonic complexity.
Yet this scale is habitat dependent, and has been expanded in other
studies when we have operated in different conditions. For instance,
in a young beech woodland (50–60 years old) without low canopy
vegetation, we chose a scale of 100 m (Farina personal comment,
Pieretti, 2008, Master's Thesis), while in a mountain ecotone with a
sparse underground the scale was set at 80 m (Farina personal comment). In fact, in temperate biomes, the density of the vegetation in
the ﬁrst few meters strongly affects the diffusion of sound, as proved
by the playback experiments conducted by Naguib et al. (2000) on
chafﬁnches (Fringilla coelebs).
The lack of signiﬁcance found in the comparison between the horizontal adjacent stations along the season and the ﬁrst horizontal nonadjacent stations, and between the vertical adjacent stations and the

ﬁrst vertical non-adjacent stations, conﬁrmed the appropriateness of
the selected distance for the placement of the recording devices.

5.2. Vegetation patterns
The vegetation has a complex pattern. This is probably due to: different soil composition and the depth of the soil, with rock outcrops in the
middle part of the area; and the recent history of repeated ﬁres, which is
a disturbance that is common to the entire Mediterranean basin
(Blondel and Aronson, 1999; Grove and Rackham, 2001; Naveh, 1974).
The intersection of different techniques of vegetation sampling was
important, conﬁrming that, at least in a Mediterranean maqui, the description of the vegetation patterns must be studied from different angles. In the study area, the maqui looks to be so dense that it would
not be possible to ﬁnd spatial discontinuities or patterned ecotones.
When investigated at the high resolution, the apparent homogenous
structure of the maqui is revealed to have a ﬁne-scale heterogeneity,
which is also veriﬁed in other Mediterranean contexts (f.i. Sardinia Island by Cody and Walter, 1976). Indeed, after a Cluster Analysis, it is
possible to clearly distinguish two separate aggregations (indicated as
A and B, see Fig. 7) that are useful for interpreting sonotope patterns.
Among the 17 variables utilized to describe the complexity of the
vegetation, the height and foliage proﬁles were the best predictors of
acoustic complexity, concurring with the spatial classiﬁcation of the
sampling stations into groups A and B.

The Morisita index did not contribute as expected to establishing a
signiﬁcant relationship with the ACI, but until now was mainly
experimented with in either homogeneous or heterogeneous
(Goodenough and Goodenough, 2012) adult forests (f.i. Stewart,
1986), and never in a dense maqui of a few meters in height. Likewise,
has never been compared with sonic complexity.
The use of different techniques to sample the vegetation helped to
deal with the uncertainty of adopting only one methodology in such a
condition. The moderate slope of the study area created further difﬁculties when it came to measuring the height of the vegetation and using
indirect methods to evaluate the height of the plants, forcing us to directly measure individual plants per individual plant.
5.3. Sonic patterns
The variability of the sonic patterns can be explained only in part by
the vegetation proxies. The emergence of temporary sonic aggregations
or soundtopes (sensu Farina et al., 2011a) is probably the result of the
acoustic interaction of the birds. Soundtopes emerge when the ACI is analyzed daily and monthly, and are proved by the presence of a great variability in the spatial distribution of the different classes of frequencies
and in the frequency footprint.
The statistical analysis conducted at different levels of the ACI aggregation (per daily session, month, frequency categories, etc.) proved the
great spatial and temporal variability of the sonic environment found
among the stations, despite their closeness (only 25 m).

Fig. 10. Cluster Analysis of the ACI values according to the different frequency classes.

The similarity in May of the ACI values observed between the two
groups found by the Cluster Analysis (A and B) could depend on the
presence of a migratory bird species (Sylvia cantillans) that prefers
edges and low shrubs and has been observed to display acoustic activity
(starting in May) in the station classiﬁed by the PCA as B.

5.4. Some caveats

Fig. 9. Spatial representation of Factor 1 resulting from the PCA of the vegetation and
spatial interpolation of the ACI when all of the sessions are averaged.

A high ACI value can be discussed for a single frequency bin or in
terms of the entire set of frequencies. In this speciﬁc case, stations
with a high ACItotal can indicate an even distribution of information
among the entire set of frequencies. Biologically speaking, this could
mean the presence of many species (high α diversity sensu Whittaker,
1972) or complex acoustic patterns. For instance, in the case of a frequency modulated song like in the robin (E. rubecula), the closeness of
a microphone to a singer allows an acoustic spectrum that is richer in information from a broader range of frequencies to be recorded. This is
unlike the case with a distant song that is degraded, especially in the

time, the presence of soundtopes that are the result of acoustic habits
is conﬁrmed.
6. Conclusions

5.5. Relationship between topography and the sonic environment
The non-signiﬁcant differences between the horizontal and vertical
stations when every station is compared with the ﬁrst adjacent one, despite the presence of slopes with a steepness of 26°, seems to rule out an
expected topographic effect with more interactions between species
and individuals along a horizontal plane, and fewer interactions between individuals and species along the line of maximum slope for
more sound dispersion.
5.6. Relationship between vegetation and the sonic environment
All of the different variables that describe the vegetation were important for depicting the complexity of the vegetation cover, but only
the Height_Au (height of A. unedo) contributed to explaining nine of
17 ACI categories, followed by Ea (average foliage proﬁle of E. arborea)
and Height_Ea (Height of E. arborea) both of which were correlated
with ﬁve ACI categories.
The best correlation between the ACI and the vegetation parameters
was found with the frequency categories 7, 8, 9 and 10. This result can
be attributed to birds that sing at these frequencies, like, for instance,
Regulus ignicapillus and S. cantillans (Farina et al., 2013). But this concordance could also be an indicator of the proximity to the microphones
of species such as E. rubecula and T. merula which, when their song is not
degraded by distance, exhibit some components of the acoustic performance placed on the highest frequencies. This point is quite important,
because the ACI cannot discriminate between the species considered
(see Farina et al., 2012), but can separate the different frequency components of a bird song captured by microphones.
The structure of the vegetation has two evident patterns: higher
vegetation on the border of the area and lower vegetation in the center,
where E. arborea is dominant. This ordination is only partially related to
the distribution of the sonic frequencies that were heterogeneous in
space and time, conﬁrming indirectly the presence of different
sonotopes, and the presence of several soundtopes that are highly variable in space along the season according to the breeding phenologies of
the different species (see Supplementary materials, SM1). A reasonable
concordance between the ACI of the entire season and the spatial representation of the Factor 1 can also be seen in Fig. 9. This demonstrates
how important the structure of vegetation is when it comes to affecting
the soundscape, structuring well recognizable sonotopes. At the same

The different methods of vegetation sampling have demonstrated
their capacity to explain some of the sonic environment characteristics.
In particular, the use of vegetation height and the vertical foliage proﬁle
seem to be two of the best proxies for matching bird biophonies, as previously outlined in a pioneering piece of work by MacArthur and
MacArthur (1961).
The ACI has demonstrated great operational ﬂexibility when it
comes to adapting the index to the sonic context, for instance in terms
of background noise removal and its capacity to describe the ﬁne structure of the sonic environment, analyzing every frequency at a particular
time.
The ACI application requires a change in the ecological paradigms,
which were until now based on the matching between individual species and environmental variables. The ACI approach considers not only
the species, but also the acoustic information that species collectively
produce during their activity, allowing a more informative dimension
of living habits to be explored. This enables important components of
behavioral habits that would otherwise be neglected by different approaches to be examined. It has been proved how informative the
acoustic signals uttered by species may be for communicating their
physical condition (Gil and Gahr, 2002) or their relationship with the
climate (Snell-Rood, 2012) and weather (Moller, 2010).
The displacement of several microphones resolves the uncertainty
about the number of species present in an area and their distribution.
In spite of an intensive effort to sample vegetation and the sonic environment, uncertainty emerges from this analysis about the relationship between vegetation and birds' biophonies if we do not adopt the
sonotope/soundtope model. Although other communication models
could be invoked to explain the sonic complexity observed (f.i.
Heterospeciﬁc attraction and competition, Mönkkönen et al., 1990, or
the Network models, Burt and Vehrencamp, 2005; Naguib, 2005, to
mention just a few), this model allows us to: explain the partial correlation between vegetation and acoustic patterns that create distinct
sonotopes, and attribute the residual variability to the intrinsic dynamics of birds during the breeding period (soundtope patterns). In fact, the
variability that emerges when sessions are confronted with each other,
and cannot be explained by vegetation patterns, may represent the dynamic connected to the “soundtope.” This seems to be one of the most
relevant conclusions that we can reach from this investigation. This
result is an important starting point for the application of the automated

sampling of acoustic diversity technique, and indicates that every
environment requires a speciﬁc spatial resolution to sample sonic
components.
In conclusion, soundscape ecology is an innovative approach to
studying the sonic complexity of the environment at different spatial
and temporal scales. Although under experimentation, appropriate
ﬁeld methods for collecting geophonic, biophonic and anthrophonic
sources, and efﬁcient metrics to process the huge quantity of acoustic
data, provide a great opportunity to investigate the contribution of
sonic processes to environmental complexity.
