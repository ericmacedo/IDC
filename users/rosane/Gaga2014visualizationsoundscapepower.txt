Soundscape Ecology is an emerging area of science that does not focus on the identiﬁcation of species in the
soundscape but attempts to characterize sounds by organizing them into those produced by biological organisms
such as birds, amphibians, insects or mammals; physical environmental factors such as thunder, rainfall or wind;
and sounds produced by human entities such as airplanes, automobiles or air conditioners. The soundscape
changes throughout the day and throughout the seasons. The soundscape components that create the sound
occur at different frequencies. A set of metrics termed soundscape power was computed and visualized to examine the patterns of daily and seasonal change in the soundscape.
Automated recorders were used to record soundscape samples every half hour for one minute duration from six
sites on an uninhabited island in Twin Lakes located near Cheboygan in Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula. Each
recording was divided into 1 kHz frequency intervals and visualization tools were used to examine the soundscape
power in each interval during 48 half-hour time segments from April–October for four consecutive years. Daily patterns of soundscape power change were also examined during the seven month sample period. To synthesize the
data set, three dimensional contour plots were used to visualize day of the year (x), time of day (y) and soundscape
power (z) for several frequency intervals. A further synthesis was developed to visualize soundscape change using a
Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) which is a ratio of low to high frequencies.
The visualization of the soundscape revealed discrete patterns in the soundscape including striking changes in
the time of the occurrence of dawn and dusk choruses. The patterns in the soundscape were remarkably similar
over the four-year investigation. Soundscape power in the lower frequency examined (1–2 kHz) was a dominant
feature of the soundscape at Twin Lakes and the low frequency soundscape power was negatively correlated with
higher frequency sounds.
The soundscape power metrics and the visualizations of the soundscape produced in this study should provide a
means of rapidly synthesizing large numbers of recordings into meaningful patterns to examine soundscape
change. This is especially useful because of the need to develop indices of ecological metrics based on soundscape
attributes to assist resource managers in making decisions about ecosystem integrity. Visualization can also be of
immense beneﬁt to examine patterns in large soundscape time series data sets that can be produced by automated recording devices.

1. Introduction
Ecosystem sounds create a soundscape comprised of acoustic
periodicities and frequencies emitted from the ecosystem's biophysical entities (Qi et al., 2008; Schafer, 1977; Truax, 1978, 1999). These sounds are
acoustic signals that reﬂect the dynamics of biological, social, and physical
systems of a landscape. Soundscape ecology is “the study of systematic relationships between humans, organisms, and their sonic environment”
(Pijanowski et al., 2011a, 2011b; Schafer, 1977, 1994) or “the study of the
effects of the soundscape on the physical responses or behavioral characteristics of living organisms in the system” (Truax, 1999).

The types of sound emanating from a landscape depend on land cover
type, time of day, and season of the year. Many animals produce sound
and use acoustic signals to communicate information such as mating potential, territory size, and potential predation (Bradbury and Vehrencamp,
2011). Increasingly, human activities are dominating our ecological
soundscapes. Anthropogenic noise may ultimately disrupt ecosystem
function by limiting distribution of some species, and negatively
impacting breeding success of others (Krause, 2012; Warren et al.,
2006). Vehicular trafﬁc alone is a large contribution to anthropogenic
noise in ecosystems. Nearly a quarter of the total land area of the conterminous United States is located within 150 m of a road (Riitters and
Wickham, 2003). This ﬁgure does not include lands impacted by other
forms of transportation including railways, aircraft, and watercraft.
Furthermore, the acoustic space of ecosystems is also signiﬁcantly

S.H. Gage, A.C. Axel / Ecological Informatics 21 (2014) 100–109

impacted by machinery related to energy extraction, industry, and residential upkeep (i.e., lawn mowers, snow blowers, leaf blowers).
Acoustic information as an ecological attribute has the potential to
increase our understanding of ecosystem change due to human disturbance, as well as provide a measure of biological diversity and its subsequent change over time (Joo et al., 2011; Sueur et al., 2008; Truax, 1984;
Wrightson, 2000). Furthermore, the analysis of soundscapes may also
produce valuable information on the dynamics of species interactions
in heterogeneous landscapes (Carles et al., 1999; Joo et al., 2011;
Pijanowski et al., 2011b). Examination of the temporal patterns of the
soundscape can provide insight into the timing of the key acoustical
events (dawn and dusk chorus), thus enabling assessment of shifts in chorus timing due to changes in climate or disturbance regimes; it may also inform decision makers about the frequency and intensity of soundscape
power, thus providing quantitative information regarding noise abatement
(Joo, 2008; Joo et al., 2011). Analyzing the patterns of acoustic signals can
also provide an insight into phenological patterns, species diversity
(Sueur et al., 2008), as well as ecosystem integrity (Qi et al., 2008).
Advances in modern technology and high-powered computation
instruments enable novel approaches for processing and quantifying
environmental acoustic data (Gage, 2003; Gage et al., 2001; Joo, 2008;
Kasten et al., 2007, 2010; Qi et al., 2008; Wimmer et al., 2011) and
extracting a variety of ecological information such as species identiﬁcation (Acevedo et al., 2009; Chou et al., 2007; Kasten et al., 2010; Towsey
et al., 2012), diversity metrics (Sueur et al., 2008), and the effects of
human noise on natural and human systems (Hannah et al., 1994;
Krausman et al., 1986; Neumann and Merriam, 1972; Romano et al.,
2004). By advancing our capacity for collecting, organizing and
searching large archives of acoustic data, we strive to enable the study
of ecological objectives that fall under the soundscape research themes
proposed by Pijanowski et al. (2011b). These research themes include
questions related to: (1) improving the measurement and quantiﬁcation of sounds, (2) improving our understanding of spatial–temporal
dynamics across different scales and how environmental covariates impact sound, (3) assessing the impact of the soundscape on humans and
wildlife, and (4) assessing the impact of human activity on soundscapes.
Automated technologies, such as those developed by Gage et al. (in
press), Wildlife Acoustics (www.wildlifeacoustics.com), Procept (2012)
(http://www.procept.com.au/customers/organisations/wireless-biophonysensors), Bedford Technical, 2012 (http://www.frogloggers.com/index.
html), and the Bioacoustics Research Program (BRP), Cornell Lab of
Ornithology (2012) (http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/hardware) enable
us to record sounds autonomously by making simultaneous recordings at
multiple places throughout the day and across seasons. This technology
provides a window on the ecological space-time continuum, and thus provides a tool to obtain data that has long been needed to assess ecological integrity. The objective of this investigation is to visualize temporal patterns in
acoustic signals of the landscape during the course of the day (diurnal
change) and across seasons to examine changes in the soundscape over
time.
To examine this temporal change in soundscape power, we analyzed
1 minute recordings collected at 30 minute intervals from April to October over a four-year period at six locations in a lacustrine forest habitat
on an island within a relatively pristine lake. Recordings were not collected from November to March due to inaccessibility of recorder sites
during winter conditions.
2. Methods
2.1. Study location
The soundscape analyzed is at the water-vegetation edge of an uninhabited island located on Twin Lakes in Grant Township, in Michigan's
northern Lower Peninsula, 20 km south east of the city of Cheboygan,
Michigan. The geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude in decimal
degrees) of the island center are 45.5401 and −84.2967 at an elevation

101

of 210 m. The island is located within a small residential community
with both year-round and summer residents. The island location was
selected in particular because there was minimal risk of human interference with acoustic recording devices. None of the recorders was disturbed during this four-year study.
The island vegetation cover consists of a mixture of 50–60 year old
deciduous and coniferous vegetations including white birch, trembling
aspen, balsam ﬁr, white cedar, tamarack and a few white pines. Extensive
wetlands line much of the island's shoreline, and the north-eastern tip of
the island overlooks the largest and deepest (30 m) portion of the lakes
(Fig. 1).
2.2. Monitoring sites
The soundscape was monitored at six sites on the island. Three sites
were established in proximity to the larger wetland areas (Crane Nest
Narrows (LA02), Tamarack Flats (LA04), and Cedar Point Bay (LA05))
and three sites were established in proximity to the larger bays Big
Lake Point (LA01), Page Bay (LA03) and Godin Circle Bay (LA06).
2.3. Soundscape sampling and data acquisition
Acoustic data was collected at each of the six sampling stations using
the Song Meter autonomous recorders (Wildlife Acoustics, 2012). The
units were scheduled to record for 1 minute duration every 30 min
for a total of 48 samples per day. Recordings were made in monaural
at 16 bits in Waveform Audio File Format (WAV) at a frequency of
22,050 kHz, providing a usable frequency range up to 11 kHz. The
Song Meters were deployed in April and removed from the sites in
October when access to sites became limited by weather conditions.
Each unit was secured to a tree with a bungee cord at 2 m height.
A total of just over 202,000 recordings were archived in the Remote
Environmental Assessment Laboratory (REAL) at Michigan State University from 2009–2012. A small subset of the recordings were removed
from the analysis or were missing for the following reasons: 1) the sensor malfunctioned due to animal damage to the microphone and resulted in recordings of static; 2) the battery died and the recorder stopped
recording; or 3) the recorded sounds were inaudible due to sensor malfunction. After ﬁltering unusable recordings, a total of 197,845 recordings, or 97.86% of the observations remained (Table 1).
Recordings were uploaded and archived in the REAL digital library as
described in Kasten et al. (2012). This digital library was used to store
recordings, compute and display soundscape metrics, and to enable
access to soundscape information for subsequent analysis and visualization. Details for uploading, processing, archiving and accessing the
soundscape recording and deriving soundscape metrics are described
and illustrated in Kasten et al. (2012).
2.4. Soundscape power metrics
Different entities in the soundscape (i.e., birds, amphibians, mammals, wind, and machinery) produce sounds at different frequencies.
Therefore, each sound recording was partitioned into 1 kHz frequency
intervals. We computed the energy in each frequency interval, termed
Power Spectral Density (PSD), as developed by Welch (1967). This
measure represents the amount of soundscape power expressed as
watts/kHz. The processing module in the REAL web site computed and
normalized the PSD value for each 1 kHz frequency interval for each
recording, thus providing a soundscape power value ranging from 0 to
1 for each of the 10 frequency intervals (1–11 kHz) (Kasten et al.,
2012). We use the term soundscape power to characterize this metric.
Vector normalization of PSD values provides a standardized PSD
(nPSD) which facilitates comparison across recordings made at different
locations. Matlab (2006) code was developed to compute nPSD values
prior to translating to PHP scripting language for the web. Matlab code

22,050 Hz recording can be obtained from gages@msu.edu.
Sounds that emanate from ecosystems can be broadly classiﬁed as
biological, anthropogenic, and geophysical. A taxonomy of sounds that
occur within ecosystems includes: biophony–biological sounds produced by organisms, typically at mid- to high frequencies (2–11 kHz);
anthrophony-sounds produced by human-made objects, typically at
lower frequencies (1–2 kHz); and geophony-sounds created by geophysical processes such as wind and rainfall which may transcend the
entire soundscape spectrum (1–11 kHz) (Pijanowski et al., 2011a,
2011b; Qi et al., 2008). Indices were derived to correspond to these
soundscape components and were used to examine changes in the
soundscape over time. In addition to computing nPSD values for each
1 kHz frequency interval, indices were also computed including total
soundscape power (∑ 1–11 kHz), low frequency soundscape power
(anthrophony) (1–2 kHz), and higher frequency soundscape power
(biophony) (∑2–11 kHz).
A Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) and a ratio of
biophony and anthrophony, were also computed (Joo, 2008; Kasten
et al., 2012). NDSI is modeled after the normalized difference vegetation

index (NDVI) used in the analysis of remotely sensed satellite imagery.
NDVI is a ratio of spectral energy in the near infrared region to the
amount in the visible red region (Rouse et al., 1974), and it is widely
used as an indicator of ecosystem function (Kerr and Ostrovsky,
2003). Healthy vegetation absorbs much of the visible light (e.g. small
spectral value) while it reﬂects much of the near-infrared light
(e.g., large spectral value) resulting in a high NDVI. On the other hand,
unhealthy, extremely dry, or sparse vegetation reﬂects more visible
light and less near-infrared light resulting in a low NDVI value. Just as
NDVI is a measure of vegetation health, we consider NDSI to be a measure of ecological health.
Like the NDVI, NDSI uses a simple algorithm to compress a large
amount of information into an ecological index. The NDSI is calculated
as follows:
ðb−aÞ=ðb þ aÞ;
where b is biophony (2–11 kHz) and a is anthrophony (1–2 kHz) (see
Kasten et al. (2012)). NDSI ranges from − 1 to + 1 where low values
of the index indicate dominance of lower frequencies (anthrophony)
and higher values of the index show dominance of higher frequencies
(biophony). We use the NDSI to determine the dominance of sound
types in ecosystems and this simple index may provide a rapid tool for
ecosystem assessment since it does not require species identiﬁcation.
2.5. Soundscape analysis
Soundscape power metrics, derived from 197,845 recordings at the
six sites were summarized, analyzed and, graphed using Minitab v 16
(Minitab 16 Statistical Software, 2010) and R 3.0.0 (R Development
Core Team, 2012). Since there was very little variation between soundscape metrics obtained from the six recorders they were treated as replicates and each of the six twice-hourly observations was averaged over
all recording sites prior to additional analyses performed. Then sound
was partitioned into 1 kHz frequency intervals, beginning at 1 kHz
and ending at 11 kHz, and soundscape power was computed for each
frequency interval. Data in the lowest interval, 0–1 kHz, was excluded

103

as this can be largely attributed to wind (Bradbury and Vehrencamp,
2011).
To examine the contribution of each frequency to total soundscape
power, soundscape power of each frequency interval as a proportion
of the total power was visualized. Then, daily and season variations in
soundscape power by frequency intervals were examined. Next, patterns of biophony and NDSI were examined through visualization of
daily and seasonal trends averaged over the 4-year period. The dawn
chorus, a peak in singing activity of birds, was deﬁned as the period
beginning two hours before sunrise and ending 3 h afterwards.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Soundscape power by frequency
The average soundscape power was highest (0.48 W/kHz) at the
lowest frequency interval (1–2 kHz), and gradually decreased as
sound frequency increased. This pattern remained consistent for each
year of the study (Fig. 2). The 1–2 kHz frequency interval represented
about 20% of total soundscape power (Fig. 3), with the remaining 80%
attributed to biological sounds (biophony). Despite the study area's
relatively rural location, sounds associated with human disturbance
(1–2 kHz) were a recognizable component of the soundscape and this
was especially true during the daylight hours. However, Canada geese
(Branta canadensis maxima), common loons (Gavia immer) and green
frogs (Rana clamitans) in the landscape were also responsible for high
soundscape power in low frequencies, especially in the evening hours.
Mid-frequency sounds (3–6 kHz) can generally be attributed to bird
calls by many species ranging from larger birds like the American robin
(Turdus migratorius) to smaller species like the common yellowthroat
(Geothlypis trichas). There is a large array of species that fall into this
category, and some speciﬁcs of bird call frequency can be found in
Napoletano (2004).
At the other end of the frequency spectrum, power within individual
high frequency intervals was quite low, but when all combined, the ﬁve
highest frequency intervals approached the magnitude of power in the
lowest. Summed together, the highest 4 frequency intervals accounted
for 19% of the total soundscape power, a value that rivals the amount
of soundscape power emitted at 1–2 kHz. At 6–11 kHz, sound power
is highest between about midnight and 4 am when insects and migrating birds are vocalizing. Based on this observation, we can detect the
presence of aerial biota such as migrating birds (Isard and Gage, 2000)
which may allow tracking of migratory bird movements along the
upper Great Lakes by documenting bursts of high frequency vocalizations of migratory birds in recordings.

April–October, 2009–1012.

Fig. 3. Percent of total soundscape power (watts/kHz) for each of 10 frequency intervals
(1–11 kHz) computed from sound recordings for the entire 24 hour period and for the
dawn chorus (from 2 h before sunrise until 3 h after sunrise).

3.2. Daily variation in soundscape power
Daily patterns of soundscape power by frequency interval reveal
differences that correspond to ecological activities (Fig. 4). The lowest
frequency power values (1–2 kHz) rose steadily after sunrise and then
peaked in late afternoon. Sounds in this range are tied to anthropogenic
activities of lake shore residents, as a very similar soundscape power signature was received by a single acoustic recording device located in a
nearby lake shore residential area. The second peak in power at this frequency occurred at night and appears to be related to low-frequency
vocalizations of amphibians (especially green frogs) and common loons.
The peak soundscape power at about 6AM in the 2–3 kHz interval is
due to the dawn chorus and this peak also represented the highest proportion soundscape power (over 40%) at that time of day. Soundscape
power in this range drops off quickly shortly after sunrise. Very similar
patterns were seen in both the 4–5 kHz and the 5–6 kHz intervals,
although soundscape power for these declined slowly throughout the
day to a low around dusk when, in both cases, soundscape power
began to rise again. In all three cases, however, power increased at
dusk to a second maxima at about 20:00.
Dawn soundscape power of biological sounds in frequency intervals
between 2 and 6 kHz (the range of many songbirds) was higher than
(or equal to) that of the 24 hour period and less than that of the
24 hour period at frequency intervals above 7 kHz (Fig. 3). There was
also less power in the anthrophic range (1–2 kHz) at dawn than across
the entire 24 hour period.
The major contributor to the 2–3 kHz frequency range and the
3–4 kHz frequency range (they overlap) during the hours of darkness
is the small but vocal frog, the northern spring peeper (Pseudacris
crucifer). Beginning at about 0600 h, birdsong replaces the calls of
peepers. In the spring (April–May) birds continue to signal to mates
throughout the day, but they sing most vociferously at dawn and to a
lesser extent at dusk. The American robin, a species that begins calling
before day break, is also the last species to sing in the evening. This
species sings in the range of 3–4 kHz see Twin Lakes Soundscape
project and to Access Data (tab) Search (tab) and select LA01-LA06,
2009–2012, June 15 at 0500 h to hear the American robin (http://
www.real.msu.edu/projects/one_proj.php?proj=la). The soundscape
power in the 4–5 kHz interval is dominated by many species of song
birds that migrate to and inhabit northern Michigan.
Peak soundscape power for 3–4 kHz and 6–7 kHz both occurred in
the morning, but after sunrise. It then declined steadily over the
day until about 20:00 at which time, soundscape power dropped

precipitously. Birds such as robins and wood warblers are responsible
for power in these frequency ranges.
At 6–11 kHz, sound power is highest between about midnight and
4 am when insects and birds are vocalizing. Soundscape power among
the 5 highest frequency intervals was remarkably similar (Fig. 5). Individually, their power contribution appears nearly inconsequential;
however, the temporal pattern of soundscape power is nearly identical
for each, suggesting that the sum of these frequencies represent animal
signals with harmonic structure.
Birds dominate frequencies between 2 and 6 kHz during the dawn
chorus, while low frequency sounds related to human disturbance are
dominant between sunrise and sunset. The high soundscape power
signal at low frequency during the day is an example of anthrophony
(see Pijanowski et al., 2011a) which consists of technical sounds made
by humans (motors), dogs, and human vocalizations. However, our observations show that animals such as the green frog, common loon,
Canada geese, sand hill crane (Grus canadensis), and coyote (Canis
latrans) also signal at low frequencies in this landscape and thus can

contribute to power in the low frequency signal range. Based on listening to the recordings during this time period, the low frequency night
time sounds in this study are most commonly attributed to green
frogs, common loons, Canada geese and dogs.
3.3. Seasonal variation in soundscape power
Visualizations of soundscape power summarized by month illustrate
seasonal patterns in soundscape power by frequency interval (Fig. 6).
The minimum value for the 1–2 kHz frequency interval occurred in May
and the maximum mean value occurred in October. The minimum values
for the higher frequency intervals occurred in August (2–3, 3–4 kHz) and
April (4–5, 5–6, 6–7 kHz). The maximum values for the frequency intervals above 1–2 kHz (2–7 kHz) occurred in April, June, September, August
and July (Table 2).
A time series of soundscape power by frequency interval across the
four year period reveals much more variation in power between frequency intervals at both the beginning and end of the season. This

pattern coincides with day length as illustrated in Fig. 7. There is less
variation in power between frequency intervals with long days than
with short days. Furthermore, sound power at 1–2 kHz in the fall is
much greater than any of the other frequency bands.
Seasonal soundscape power patterns depend on the frequency in the
soundscape. For example, the 1–2 kHz interval had high power early in
the monitoring period (early spring), then decreased slightly to a relatively stable period during summer, and then increased to a maximum
in late fall. While this may be attributed largely to changes in anthropogenic activities across the period, we know that some prominent seasonal organisms, such as green frogs, vocalize in this range as well.
On the other hand, the soundscape power pattern of 2–3 kHz was at
its highest level in early spring when spring peepers dominate the
soundscape, then dropped steadily until early fall (0.3 W/kHz) until
late fall when it began increasing again due to singing insects such as
crickets. Soundscape power at 3–4 kHz was low in early spring then
rose to a high soundscape power in spring (dawn chorus), dropped in
summer, then rose again in fall. The soundscape power in the 4–5 kHz
interval had a similar pattern to that of 3–4 kHz where power had
a low value in early spring, increased in spring (due to breeding
birds), dropped in summer and then increased in late summer and
early fall (due to insects) and then subsequently dropped again in late
fall. Soundscape power in the 5–6 kHz began very low in early spring,
rose during spring, and had a sharp increase in late summer (with
a very consistent peak in August that may be due to crickets) and
then declined in fall. Soundscape power at 6–7 kHz is low in early

spring, peaked in summer, then declined in August, and rose slightly
in late fall.
Fig. 8 illustrates the position of soundscape power (z) for each of the
ﬁrst six frequency intervals with respect to day of year (x) and time of
day (y) and highlights the degree of frequency overlap, or lack thereof,
of the soundscape power from April–October. The 1–2 kHz interval is
dominant (N 0.5 W/kHz) from May (JD 91–120) during 0800 to 2000.
Soundscape power at 1–2 kHz increases at night (2100–0400) and remains high (N0.5 W/kHz) until mid-July (JD 200). Soundscape power
at 1–2 kHz is also present during daytime from mid-July onward and
extending to both day and night by 1 September (JD 244). There is a
strong soundscape power signal at 1–2 kHz from late-May to late-July
(140–200 JD) at (2000–0800) night time. A strong soundscape power
signal in the 2–3 kHz frequency range occurs at night time (2000 and
0700) during late spring (JD 91–140). This signal disappears from
the soundscape in late June (JD 180). A soundscape power signal at
3–4 kHz is evident from late-May to late-July (140–200 JD) during
daytime hours (0800–2000). A soundscape power signal at 4–5 kHz is
evident from mid-August to mid-September (JD 230–260) at night
time (2000–0500). An additional 4–5 kHz soundscape power signal is
evident from late-May until August (JD 140–220) during daytime
hours (0800–1600). A soundscape power signal at 5–6 kHz from lateJuly until September (JD 201–250) during night time overlaps
with the 4–5 kHz night time signal. The soundscape power signal
at 6–7 kHz signal is weak but evident from late-May to late-July
(JD 140–220) during daylight hours (0600–1100).

3.4. Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI)
Average NDSI over all days varies throughout the 24 hour period,
but it is highest (representing the greatest biological sound) at dawn

and in the couple hours before midnight (Fig. 9). The daily NDSI pattern (Fig. 10) reveals a strong biological signal during nighttime that
tapers off until about noon. There is a small exception in early April
(JD 100) and a larger exception between early June through mid-July

(JD 150–190) and again mid-September through early October
(JD 260–280) where the NDSI signal is lower but still in the biophony
range (0–1). The low index value during early summer (JD 150–190)
is due to the dominance of green frog (R. clamitans) low-frequency
vocalizations during this time period; the green frog's calls register at
frequencies that are presumed in the anthrophonic frequency range
and thereby reduce the NDSI. An examination of the NDSI during daylight hours (0500–2000) shows that the NDSI signal is most intense in
June (JD 140–180) and extends well into the day before declining in
intensity and then again increasing at dusk.
NDSI is a ratio of high frequency sound power to low frequency
sound power. High frequency sounds are mostly biological while low
frequency sounds are considered primarily anthropogenic in nature.
Just as NDVI is a measure of vegetation health, we consider NDSI to be
a measure of ecological health.
In this relatively undisturbed habitat we expect NDSI to be high and
stable across the time period, and the data support this hypothesis with
NDSI values each year at about 0.6 (Fig. 11). In addition, we show that
high NDSI values align very well with dawn chorus and low NDSI aligns
well with day time anthropogenic activities (Fig. 10). However, organisms with low frequency calls sometime dominate this particular
soundscape. This is not typical of all soundscapes, so it is not necessarily
a shortcoming of the index. It is important, though, to account for dominant biologic and anthropogenic sources of sound that fall outside their
typical ranges within individual soundscapes. In our case, we are working on algorithms (especially pattern recognition) to separate common
loon and green frog vocalizations from anthrophic components of the
1–2 kHz range.

4. Conclusions and future work
Patterns in soundscape power by frequency observed over a daily
24 hour-cycle may reﬂect temporal partitioning of acoustic space by
taxa. Vocalizing animals are believed to ﬁnd and utilize acoustic spaces
(“niches”) that are not ﬁlled by other sounds (either biological or
anthropogenic), a theory known as the “acoustic niche hypothesis”
(Krause, 1987). This results in both spatial and temporal separation of
calls that might otherwise fall within the same frequency range. In our
Michigan lake soundscape, animals with low frequency vocalizations
called during the evenings when human-induced low frequency sounds
were much reduced.
Despite the presence of anthropogenic activities on the soundscape, it
appears that this landscape does not suffer the detrimental effects of vehicular noise from urban morning rush hour. Consequently, birds singing
during the dawn chorus appear to be relatively unaffected by humangenerated sounds. In particularly noisy environments such as cities, it
has been shown that animals may alter the frequency at which they
call (Francis et al., 2011; Slabbekoorn and den Boer-Visser, 2006). By
examining the spectral components of an entire soundscape over time,
it is possible to document niche partitioning and spectral shifts over time.
The ultimate goal of soundscape analysis is to utilize tools such as the
NDSI to track changes in the ecological health of soundscapes over time
and to also compare health among different soundscapes. We have
shown here that NDSI is directly related to biological activity and in
the future, we plan to explore differences in NDSI by soundscape
using ﬁeld data for assessment.
A soundscape embodies the sounds of all aspects of an ecosystem,
both biotic and abiotic, yet it is the biotic portion that remains of most interest to ecologists because this relates most directly to ecosystem process and function. As we strive to better understand how ecosystems
will respond to changes in climate and human disturbance, monitoring
acoustic phenology of terrestrial landscapes over time can give us an insight into the presence and timing of important phenological events such
as migration, mating, and reproduction. Indeed, this is the basis of acoustic monitoring programs such as the United States National Park Service
Inventory and Monitoring, Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and
Synthesis, as well as the Remote Environmental Assessment Laboratory.
By recording soundscape power over entire seasons and multiple
years we have illustrated changes in the diel cycle of dawn and dusk
chorus, an important ecosystem attribute tied to abiotic factors. This is
especially useful for examination of the timing of the chorus related to
changes in climate. For instance, at this location, acoustic data help us

108

S.H. Gage, A.C. Axel / Ecological Informatics 21 (2014) 100–109

to identify timing of the following bird phenology: major migrant arrival
(April–May), territory establishment (May–June), breeding (June–July),
ﬂedging (July), migration preparation (August–September) and migration south (September–October).
Migratory routes along the Great Lake shorelines are being observed
by radar to better understand the distribution of birds along their fall
migratory routes (Bonter and Donovan, 2009; Diehl et al., 2003; Ewert
et al., 2011). However, radar data don't provide an indication of the species make-up of groups detected by radar signals. Acoustic recorders
have been used to identify species of birds passing over a particular
site (Bastas, 2011). While radar remote sensing provides important
data on bird migration patterns at large spatial scales, acoustic remote
sensing has the potential to provide an insight into species makeup of
migratory groups at long temporal scales (Farnsworth and Russell,
2007: Evans and O'Brian, 2002). Our data suggests that birds are indeed
moving along this migratory route and we recommend investigators
who are interested primarily in nocturnal migratory bird vocalizations
consider acquiring a microphone designed speciﬁcally for night ﬂight
calls.
The goal of this study has been to examine the dynamics of soundscape power in a minimally-disturbed soundscape over a period of
four years to reveal general patterns in this soundscape. In the future
we will compare these patterns to the soundscape power patterns in
other soundscapes around the world to examine the commonality of
our ﬁndings as we hypothesize that similar patterns in soundscape
power exist during comparable times of the year (dawn chorus, etc.).
We discovered that acoustic signals of this particular soundscape repeat
from year to year indicating a phenological signature for the site. Variations at some frequencies indicate responses that are tied more closely
to climate and suggest the next step for analysis. Our work will begin
to examine the soundscape patterns of those species that are relatively
easy to identify and progress to examining those species with more
complex signals. For instance, since we have archived all the recordings
and their metrics from this study, we will identify the speciﬁc entities
that produce the soundscape power. For example, we will focus on a
species like the spring peeper (P. crucifer) which is a harbinger of spring
in the northern latitudes and determine its ﬁrst call occurrence, within
the ½ h, over multiple years and then relate it to differences in meteorological conditions. We will also examine the call of the common
loon to determine the variation in time and location of call in this six
site landscape since we have developed an algorithm to automatically
detect the calls of this species. In addition, we will isolate the loon
acoustic signal from the anthrophony signal using pattern recognition
so that we can include the low frequency calls of the loon with the
higher frequency biophony in the soundscape.
As acoustic data is collected and cataloged on additional
soundscapes, we will be better able to assess the value, and role of,
soundscape attributes in understanding landscape patterns and processes (Pijanowski et al., 2011b). The value of a data set such as the
one we used to examine soundscape power provides the opportunity
to identify temporal patterns within acoustic data which then lead to
further investigations into understanding the effects of environmental
change and human impacts on soundscapes. Furthermore, with a
baseline understanding of multiple soundscapes, the opportunity to
begin delving into spatio-temporal dynamics across space becomes
possible.
