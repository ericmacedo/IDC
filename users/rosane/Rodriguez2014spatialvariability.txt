Soundscape ecology aims to use biological, geophysical and anthropogenic sound to understand natural-human
landscape dynamics. The analysis of natural soundscapes with no human noise is a prerequisite to understand
and quantify the effects of human activity on animal ecology linked to sound. Preserved tropical forests are the location of unique, highly diverse, and animal sound. However, although the acoustic behavior of several tropical species has been examined, very few analyses have attempted tropical sounds at a spatial scale able to incorporate
landscape characters. Here we analyze the acoustic structure of a neotropical forest landscape in French Guiana.
We used a four dimensional synchronous acoustic sampling (three spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension) by deploying an array of 24 microphones in the understory and canopy of the Nouragues Nature Reserve during a 43 day period and we undertook a detailed signal analysis to detect spatial and temporal animal acoustic
heterogeneity. We identiﬁed a clear pattern of acoustic activity with four distinct periods of activity that differed
by their spectral characteristics indicating acoustic heterogeneity along the 24-hour cycle but periodicity at a
longer time scale. We revealed acoustic divergences between the understory and the canopy layers in terms of
amplitude level and frequency content. We highlighted vertical (understory/canopy) and horizontal acoustic
heterogeneities with a more diverse (frequency) patch in the north of the study area sampled and a more active
(intensity) patch in the southeast of the study area. Our results show that the soundscape of a tropical forest, in
the absence of human disturbance, is subtly structured in time and is heterogeneous in space. This structure is
probably linked to endogenous factors that rule out the acoustic time activity of animal species, to the vertical
stratiﬁcation of singing communities or guilds, to horizontal variations in the distributions of species and to vegetation spatial heterogeneity. Our study emphasizes that tropical soundscapes need to be recorded and analyzed
in considerable spatial and temporal detail to understand their dynamics without the presence of human produced noise. Our analysis also suggests that tropical forests are unique places for acoustic diversity, supporting
the need for preservation from all perturbations including anthropic noise.

1. Introduction
A bridge between bioacoustics – the study of animal sound
communication – and landscape ecology was recently built through
the formalization and conceptualization of soundscape ecology, a new
discipline for the life sciences (Farina et al., 2011a,b; Pijanowski et al.,
2011a,b). Soundscape ecology mainly aims to analyze the interactions
between ecological processes and all sounds arising from a landscape,
namely the soundscape (Pijanowski et al., 2011b). Soundscape ecology
naturally derives from pioneer work on natural or urban soundscapes
(Schafer, 1977; Southworth, 1969; Truax, 1978) and follows recent
work originally presented as “landscape bioacoustics” (Laiolo and
Tella, 2006) or research establishing a clear linkage between the

landscape and the acoustic environment (Matsinos et al., 2008,
Mazaris et al., 2009). Soundscape ecology tries to join bioacoustics and
landscape ecology to understand the patterns and processes of soundscape heterogeneity and variation (Pijanowski et al., 2011b). One of
main challenges of soundscape ecology is the identiﬁcation of soundscape dynamics in time and space in reference to natural and/or anthropogenic sources of variation (Pijanowski et al., 2011b). To achieve this,
several tools have been exploited or speciﬁcally developed as automated recorders (Acevedo and Villanueva-Rivera, 2006), signal analysis algorithms (Bormpoudakis et al., 2013; Gasc et al., 2013a,b; Kasten et al.,
2012; Pieretti et al., 2010; Qi et al., 2008; Sueur et al., 2008a,b; Towsey
et al., 2012; Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011; Wimmer et al., 2013) and
sound library management systems (Kasten et al., 2012; VillanuevaRivera and Pijanowski, 2012).
As a recent discipline, soundscape ecology needs to ﬁrstly describe
the patterns of the soundscape before trying to explain the processes

structuring the soundscape. Until now, several studies have focused on
the spatial and temporal pattern of temperate soundscapes revealing
an important level of variability at a local scale in relation with biological processes, human activities and geophysical phenomena (Farina
et al., 2011a, 2011b; Joo et al., 2011; Krause et al., 2011; Matsinos
et al., 2008; Mazaris et al., 2009; Sueur et al., 2008a,b) but less studies
have been conducted on tropical soundscapes (Pekin et al., 2012).
Most of these founder analyses investigated temperate soundscapes
that were perturbed to different degrees by anthropogenic noise and
land use. Such sound environments are of high interest to estimate
the relative contribution of biophony (sounds produced by animal
species), geophony (sounds originating from the geophysical environment) and anthropophony (sounds emanating from human activity),
the three main components of a soundscape as deﬁned by Krause
(1998, 2008). However, it remains necessary to decipher the composition and dynamics of primary soundscapes to try to understand
the natural processes beyond soundscape dynamics. Moreover, temperate soundscapes embrace rather low levels of acoustic diversity
(Depraetere et al., 2012, Pijanowski et al., 2011a) while tropical acoustic
soundscapes have been shown to reach very high levels of sound diversity (Diwakar et al., 2007; Riede, 1993, 1997). So far, these acoustics
elements have been analyzed in the framework of bioacoustics focusing
mainly on the behavior of speciﬁc taxa, as amphibians (Amézquita et al.,
2011; Chek et al., 2003), birds (Luther, 2009; Planqué and Slabbekoorn,
2008), and insects (Diwakar and Balakrishnan, 2007a), even if some
rare studies tried to include several taxa (Hammer and Barrett, 2001;
Riede, 1997; Slabbekoorn, 2004; Sueur et al., 2008a). The complexity of
tropical forest structure from the understory to the canopy offers different micro-habitats (Basset et al., 2003; Richards, 1996; Smith, 1973;
Terborgh, 1985) that can be occupied by distinct vocalizing species.
This potentially leads to a heterogeneous soundscape that can be complicated with different constraints on sound propagation in relation to
habitat and micro-habitat structures (Marten et al., 1977; Morton,
1975; Richards and Wiley, 1980). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a single study that has been conducted on the heterogeneity of a tropical soundscape (Pekin et al., 2012). In this study, the acoustic
diversity could be spatially predicted by LIDAR (LIght Detection and
Ranging) metrics describing the vertical structure of the forest, suggesting that acoustic diversity could be strongly linked to the vertical complexity of the canopy.
Soundscape dynamics such as periodicity, and horizontal and vertical heterogeneities are poorly known in tropical ecosystems before deforestation, therefore, there is an important need to record, describe,
analyze and quantify them quickly. In this paper, we report the ﬁrst description of a tropical soundscape sampled in four dimensions: the three
spatial dimensions and the time dimension. We deployed 24
microphones that recorded synchronously the understory and the
canopy soundscapes of a French Guiana tropical forest reserve. Using
multivariate analysis of amplitude and frequency components of the
soundscape associated with original spatial heterogeneity analysis
transferred from population genetics, we found a clear diurnal cycle
composed of four periods and important spatial differences along the
horizontal and vertical axes of the forest. This indicates a high level of
heterogeneity likely due to a high level of animal diversity and to a complex partitioning of the acoustic resource.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
We deployed a four dimensional acoustic sampling scheme in a section of tropical forest managed by the French CNRS Nouragues Research
Station (4°05′N; 54°40′W) within the Nouragues Nature Reserve
(Fig. 1a). This 48 ha forest research station area is located in an
inhabited region at the center of French Guiana, 100 km away from
the main city Cayenne and 60 km away from the nearest village Regina.

The climate is equatorial with a mean temperature of 26.3°, and a weak
thermal amplitude of 2 °C. The mean annual rainfall is 3000 mm over
280 days per year (Grimaldi and Riéra, 2001). The annual cycle is constituted of a dry season from September to November, a rainy season
from January to June, and a short dry season in March within the rainy
season (Grimaldi and Riéra, 2001). Sunrise is at 06:15 am and sunset
at 06:10 pm.
The Nouragues site has not undergone any anthropogenic perturbations since the Noraks, the native Amerindians, who disappeared during
the eighteenth century (Charles-Dominique, 2001). The vegetation
cover consists of a dense evergreen forest with trees typically reaching
a height of 30 to 45 m. The exact study area is located on the main plateau, which has a clayey soil with a vertical drainage where trees can
deeply root (Grimaldi and Riéra, 2001) (Fig. 1b). This area is covered
with a high diversity of tree species including 550 species belonging to
63 families. The Caesalpinaceae is the most important family in terms
of species richness, density and dominance, followed by the Sapotaceae
and the Lecythidaceae (Poncy et al., 2001).
2.2. Sampling protocol
To regularly record the soundscape of the forest, we placed 24
microphones in the three spatial dimensions. These microphones
covered two grids at two different heights (see details below). We
used the two channels of 12 autonomous digital recording Song Meter
2 devices (Wildlife Acoustics, Massachusetts, USA, 2010) each equipped
with weatherproof omni-directional microphones that have a ﬂat frequency response in the range 0.02–20 kHz.
The recorders were spaced by using a regular array of linear trails
previously named with a letter (K, M, O) or a Roman number (XI, XIII,
XV, XVII). The trails drew a rectangular area divided into 12 squares
with a side of 200 m in length. The recorders were settled at the crossing
of trails (i.e. at the positions K-XI, K-XIII, K-X, K-XVII, M-XI, …, O-XVII).
For each recorder, one of the two microphones was positioned at a
height of 1.50 m to record the acoustic activity of the understory and
the other was positioned at a height of 20 m to record the acoustic activity of the canopy. Due to limited access to the canopy we could not run
acoustic propagation experiments or model sound propagation around
each microphone to estimate the area covered by each recording site.
However, knowing that terrestrial animals produce sound with an intensity of circa 80 dB at 1 m re. 2 × 10−5 μPa (Sueur et al., 2012) and
that the microphones have a sensitivity of −36 ± 4 dB, we could estimate that in a closed habitat, such as a tropical forest, each microphone
would detect animal sound activity in a circle with a radius of about
100 m. We avoided overlap between adjacent microphones. However,
comparison of recordings between understory and canopy microphones clearly showed a certain amount of acoustic overlap (see section
3).
We recorded the soundscape at the end of the dry season, from
November 10th 2010 to December 22nd 2010. We recorded one minute
every ﬁfteen minutes, day and night. The recordings of each site were
synchronized. This generated 99072 ﬁles (12 sites × 2 vertical
levels × 4 recordings/h × 24 h × 43 days) for a total of 1634 h of
recording. Due to a problem when programming the recording schedule, the recording time slot at 11:45 pm had to be removed from the
analysis. In addition, 556 ﬁles (site M-XVII, from November 3rd 2010
to December 6th 2010) were also corrupted and had to be withdrawn.
This led to a total of 98473 ﬁles. We processed all recordings at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and we stored the recordings in the form of
Wildlife Acoustics Audio Compression (WAC) ﬁles, which we subsequently converted into Waveform AudioFile Format (WAV) with the
software ‘WAC to WAV Converter Utility’ (v1.1, Wildlife Acoustics,
2009) for purposes of analysis. One of us (AR) listened to the recordings
to exclude ﬁles corrupted with high background noise due to wind and
heavy rain (geophony) or helicopter ﬂights, the only source of human
noise (anthropophony).

trails.

2.3. Spectral analysis
We assessed acoustic differences between all pairwise recordings
by estimating the dissimilarity of pairs of frequency spectra. Using the
R package seewave (Sueur et al., 2008a,b), we obtained a frequency
spectrum for each recording by (1) computing a short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) with a 512 samples sliding but non-overlapping
Hamming window, (2) averaging the columns of the resulting matrix
(here it refers to its temporal dimension); and (3) scaling the amplitude
averaged values by their integral. This procedure returned an average
frequency spectrum with a frequency resolution of 86.13 Hz and a
relative amplitude scale. We subsequently calculated a dissimilarity
metric, named the Df index (Sueur et al., 2008a,b), according to:
D f ¼ 0:5 x sum jS1 ð f Þ–S2 ð f Þj
where S1(f) and S2(f) are the probability mass functions of the mean
spectra of the two recordings to be compared.
We ran a distance-based multidimensional analysis in order to
visualize whether the factors “Time” and “Site” could explain the acoustic variability, and which of these two factors was the most important in
explaining the acoustic differences observed. We divided the “Time”
factor into 24 categories corresponding to the 24 hours of the day.
Each category was composed with the four recordings of each hour
(e. g. 1:00 pm, 1:15 pm, 1:30 pm and 1:45 pm). We deﬁned the “Site”
factor with 24 categories corresponding to the 24 microphone locations (12 in the canopy and 12 in the understory). We computed the
spectral metric Df between all pairs of recording ﬁles leading to a
ﬁrst 10731*10731 dissimilarity matrix. We ﬁrst applied a Principal
Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) (Gower, 1966) on this distance matrix
and we then applied a principal component analysis with respect to
instrumental variables (PCAIV, Rao, 1964) on the coordinates returned

by PCoA analysis. Each point projected in the resulting multidimensional
space represented the acoustic position of one site, one recorder, at one
hour. We ran all these multidimensional analyses with the R package
ade4 (Dray and Dufour, 2007).
To estimate differences between adjacent recording spots, we transferred techniques used to detect genetic barriers between geographically distinct populations to detect acoustic barriers or differences
between distinct recording sites. We used the Monmonier's algorithm
(Monmonier, 1973), which detects boundaries by ﬁnding the path
exhibiting the largest differences provided in a genetic distance matrix
between neighboring populations localized with geographic coordinates. Here, we considered each microphone as a population localized
with its latitude and longitude coordinates and we considered the
distance matrix obtained with the spectral Df index as the genetic
distance matrix. We used the Barrier 2.2 software (Manni et al., 2004)
that ﬁrst created a Voronoi tessellation and a Delonay triangulation
with the spatial coordinates of the microphones. This preliminary
process deﬁned the proximity web of axes where acoustic barriers
could be drawn. Monmonier's algorithm was used to calculate the
path of the decreasing acoustic distances and, lastly, the software
projected the acoustic barriers onto a map where their thicknesses
were correlated with acoustic dissimilarity between adjacent microphones. The Monmonnier's algorithm is not accompanied by a statistical procedure that tests barrier thickness. However, we deﬁned the
main barriers as those found in the last quartile (75–100%) of the barrier
thickness distribution. This ensured an objective criterion of selection.

2.4. Amplitude analysis
We estimated the variation in space and time of the soundscape
amplitude. The amplitude of each ﬁle was measured using the root-

136

A. Rodriguez et al. / Ecological Informatics 21 (2014) 133–143

mean-square (RMS) of the absolute value of the wave of each recording.
We decomposed the time series of amplitude variation along days using
a moving average and an additive model with three components (trend
component, seasonal component and error or random component). We
estimated the periodicity of these time series with an auto-correlation
function (Shumway and Stoffer, 2006). The auto-correlation function
consisted of correlating the original time series with itself after a speciﬁc
time lag. The auto-correlation shows local maxima when the time lag
corresponds to a periodic event. Time series decomposition and autocorrelation was estimated on raw recordings (i.e. without removing
recordings, including helicopter or rain noise). Results are reported for
a single site but were representative of all others sites.
We also calculated the median of the acoustic amplitude for each
time of the day (factor “Time”) and we used this median as a variable.
The values were log transformed to reach normality. Variation between
recording sites (factor “Site”) and between the understory and canopy
was visualized using boxplot representations. We tested the differences
between the sound amplitudes monitored in the understory and the
canopy with a parametric two-sided t-test for paired samples with unequal variances. We corrected the p-value with a Bonferroni correction
for multiple tests (n = 12). We mapped linear sound amplitude spatial
variation using a circle with a radius and a background color scaled with
the median of the relative amplitude level recorded at each recording
spot. This led to a plot representing twelve amplitude medians. We
assessed the statistical distribution of these amplitude medians with a
kernel density estimation and we also calculated the median and the
median absolute deviation of the medians to give an estimation of the
amplitude of the soundscape. We did not attempt to use any spatial
models because the spatial resolution was too low, with only 12 sampling points, to allow reliable predictions.
3. Results
3.1. Spectral analysis
We estimated the variation in time and space of the soundscape
of the tropical forest by running distance-based multidimensional
analyses on a spectral dissimilarity matrix obtained between pairs of
recordings. The “Time” factor revealed a structure along the day-night
cycle on the ﬁrst two axes of the multidimensional analysis which explained 3.2% of the variability (Fig. 2). We could identify four distinct periods: (1) a long transition morning period from 1:00 am to 9:00 am;

(2) a day period from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm; (3) a short transition evening period from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm; and (4) a night period from
7:00 pm to 1:00 am. The “Site” factor did not show any particular structure along the understory and canopy arrays respectively but showed a
difference between the understory and canopy positions as indicated by
the two ﬁrst axes of the multidimensional analysis which explained
1.3% of the variability (Fig. 3). We therefore identiﬁed a coherent spatial
structure along the vertical axis but not along the horizontal axes of the
3D arrays of microphones.
To investigate more speciﬁcally the horizontal pattern, we obtained
Monmonier maps that indicated relative spectral differences between
adjacent recording sites (Fig. 4). These maps showed important acoustic
barriers in the northern part of the studied area revealing contrasting
soundscapes. In particular the K-XI recording site was always acoustically
very different at both the understory and canopy levels from its neighboring recording sites (K-XIII, M-XI), except during the day period
(9:00 am–6:00 pm). The recording site M-XI also appeared acoustically
distinct from the three neighboring recording sites (K-XI, O-XI, M-XIII).
M-XIII was acoustically different from its surrounding recording sites
(K-XIII, M-XI, M-XV, O-XIII) during the day period (9:00 am–
6:00 pm). Except for the recording site K-XVII, which differed from
recording sites K-XV and M-XVII during the day period (9:00 am–
6:00 pm), the southern part of the maps did not show signiﬁcant acoustic barriers, denoting a homogeneous soundscape.

3.2. Amplitude analysis
We decomposed the times series of amplitude variation with an
additive model (Fig. 5a). The trend component of the model showed a
regular pattern (Fig. 5b) when the error or random component was
made of accidental events (Fig. 5c). The auto-correlation analysis clearly
showed that the regular pattern of the trend component followed a
24 hour cycle (Fig. 5d). The trend component alternated low and high
amplitude levels. In particular, the microphones placed in the understory
showed a small amplitude peak between 6:00 am and 7:00 am, an
amplitude trough between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm, and high levels
between 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm. The microphones settled in the canopy
revealed low values between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm and high values
between 8:00 pm and 9:00 pm and during all the night. There was
then a + 2 h lag between the understory and the canopy at twilight
hours. The accidental events revealed by the random component were

mainly due to helicopter ﬂights, heavy rain and loud howler monkey
(Alouatta seniculus) choruses.
We found that the amplitude of the understory soundscape was
mainly lower than the amplitude of the canopy soundscape (Fig. 6).
During the morning period, this difference was signiﬁcant for all recording sites except M-XVII. During the day period, this difference was less
clear as it was not signiﬁcant for K-XVII and the difference was inversed,
i.e. the understory soundscape was louder than the canopy soundscape,
for M-XIII, M-XVII, O-XI, O-XIII and O-XVII. During the evening period,
we found that half of the recording sites had a quieter understory
soundscape than the canopy soundscape. During the night period, we
observed that the understory was always signiﬁcantly quieter than
the canopy. The differences along the vertical axis were therefore
more pronounced during night than during the other periods of the
24-hour cycle.
When mapping the amplitude median by time periods for both
understory and canopy strata, we revealed a higher amplitude in the
southern part of the area (trails XV and XVII) with a particularly high
amplitude in the square made of the recording sites K-XV, K-XVII,
M-XV and M-XVIII at any time of the 24-hour cycle (Fig. 7). This square
was therefore louder, suggesting either a higher density of vocalizing
animals or the presence of species that vocalize more loudly. We could
also identify the recording site O-XIII in the understory in the evening
and the recording site M-XI in the canopy during the day as two other
important sound sources. The density distribution of the amplitude
medians showed a low and sharp proﬁle during the morning and day
periods at both understory and canopy levels (understory morning:
363 ± 97; canopy morning: 576 ± 148; understory day: 277 ± 83;
canopy day: 243 ± 107; median ± median absolute deviation). The
distribution of the amplitude medians showed a high and wide proﬁle
during the evening and night periods, in particular in the canopy stratum (understory evening: 631 ± 276; canopy evening: 1249 ± 472;
understory night: 551 ± 228; canopy night: 1146 ± 433).

4. Discussion
Tropical forests are renowned for holding the highest levels of plant
and animal species richness (Basset et al., 2012; Giam et al., 2012; Myers
et al., 2000). However accelerated wood exploitation, agricultural extension and urbanization threaten this unique diversity and generate
landscapes with complex natural-human dynamics (Lawton et al.,

1998; Whitmore, 1997; Wright, 2005). Tropical forest soundscapes
undoubtedly generate rich natural sound environments with a complex
mix of amphibian, mammal, bird and arthropod sounds (Riede, 1993,
1997). Soundscape ecology has been recently introduced as a new
way to analyze variation over space and time reﬂecting important
landscape processes and human activities (Pijanowski et al., 2011a,b).
A soundscape analysis of an intact tropical forest area should then
enlighten the animal dynamics of a natural landscape before the entrance of human noise. To estimate the structure of an unaltered tropical
soundscape, we deployed for the ﬁrst time a large and long acoustic
sampling in the Nouragues Nature Reserve, a preserved area localized
in the middle of the Guiana forest. This remote sensing of the forest
soundscape revealed different crossed levels of temporal and spatial
heterogeneities.

4.1. Temporal heterogeneity
We ﬁrst found that the spectral content and the amplitude level of
the soundscape ﬂuctuated with time. A multidimensional analysis
based on frequency dissimilarities did not return obvious breaks along
time but a rather circular continuum of variability with four main
overlapping periods and a more pronounced difference between day
and night. In terms of amplitude, we could also clearly identify a
24-hour cycle with a low peak at dawn, a high peak at dusk and higher
amplitudes during the night than during the day. Finally, in our study
the soundscape of the tropical forest was heterogeneous along the
night–day cycle but homogeneous at an over-day scale.
The difference between the day and the night soundscapes was
expected as singing species follow diel patterns due to endogenous or
exogenous constraints (Henwood and Fabrick, 1979; McNamara et al.,
1987). In particular, birds and cicadas mainly sing during the day,
while amphibians, mammals, crickets and katydids are mostly active
during the night. Such patterns have been frequently reported at a
species level but rarely at community or landscape levels (Ellinger and
Hödl, 2003; Gasc et al., 2013a,b; Riede, 1997). The transition between
the night and day soundscapes was obvious with amplitude rises at
dawn and dusk and spectral differences. However, if it was clear that
birds and howler monkeys were more active at dawn and Orthoptera
at dusk (AG and JS observation), we did not ﬁnd very intense, brief,
strictly limited in time, and ﬁnely structured dawn–dusk choruses as
reported at other tropical sites (Riede, 1997; Schwartz, 1994; Sueur,

2002; Young, 1981). This might be due to the fact that cicadas and
amphibians, which are the main components of dawn–dusk choruses, were not breeding in high number at this period of the
year.
Our sampling did not cover a year as we intentionally recorded
the soundscape during the dry season to avoid losing important noise
due to rainfalls. Extension of the sampling through the rainy season
would certainly have revealed heterogeneity over days and seasons
due to the sound produced by cicadas, which emerge intensively at
ﬁrst rains (Wolda, 1989; Young, 1972) and to the extremely intense vocalizations of amphibians emanating from explosive breeding after
heavy rainfalls (Gottsberger and Gruber, 2004; Savage, 2002). The

soundscape of the rainy season remains therefore to be described and
we can predict that seasons will lead to an additional level in soundscape dynamics.
4.2. Spatial heterogeneity
In addition to a temporal variation, we also revealed a three
dimensional spatial variation. A previous work established a link between forest vertical structure and soundscape structure by confronting
LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging) and acoustic data gathered above
ground over six days (Pekin et al., 2012). Here, we could settle for the
ﬁrst time an array of microphones at 1.5 and 20 m respectively sensing

both understory and canopy soundscapes over a long period. We detected amplitude and spectral differences between the understory and
canopy soundscapes even if the acoustic volume covered by the microphones of each pair certainly overlapped in part.
The spectral analysis indicated differences between the understory
and the canopy suggesting distinct soundscapes due to the occurrence
of different species conﬁrming pioneer observations conducted in a
Bornean lowland forest (Riede, 1997). These differences were more
important during the night than during other periods probably because
of a higher diversity in species vocalizing during the night. Similar
results were found for temperate bird communities. The differences
between the communities were higher at dawn chorus time when
species diversity was at its maximum (Depraetere et al., 2012). The
understory and canopy differences might be explained with the acoustic
adaptation hypothesis that stipulates that the evolution of acoustic
properties of animal songs is shaped by selection dependent on
habitat or micro-habitat structure (Marten et al., 1977; Morton, 1975).
However, this hypothesis still remains debated (Boncaraglio and Saino,
2007; Ey and Fischer, 2009) and is difﬁcult to test in such complex
habitat and soundscape. Several studies have reported a vertical stratiﬁcation of acoustic guilds with species singing only in the ﬁrst vertical
layers of the forest and others inhabiting only the canopy, considering

birds (Luther, 2009; Pearson, 1971), anurans (Hödl, 1977; Lüddecke
et al., 2000), bats (Bernard, 2001), cicadas (Sueur, 2002) or katydids
and crickets (Diwakar and Balakrishnan, 2007b; Jain and Balakrishnan,
2012; Schmidt et al., 2013). Such microhabitat selection induces different
communities and therefore soundscapes. This vertical heterogeneity
interfered with the temporal heterogeneity as a +2 h lag was observed
between the amplitude of the canopy and understory soundscapes. This
time shift might be the result of different micro-climatic and ambient
light conditions between the low and high forest strata as described
at the Nouragues (Bongers et al., 2001) and at other tropical sites
(Barker, 1996; Madigosky, 2004).
The canopy soundscape appeared louder than the understory soundscape. This amplitude difference could be due to: (i) better sound propagation conditions in the canopy; (ii) the occurrence of louder species in
the canopy; and/or (iii) a higher number of active individuals in the
canopy. All three hypotheses are very difﬁcult to test as they require
full access to the canopy, which is in addition a complex acoustic
environment due to the occurrence of acoustic boundaries, interfering
objects, temperature gradients and wind gradients that counteract
and vary with time (Richards and Wiley, 1980). However, propagation
experiments in Panama did not show signiﬁcant differences at heights
of 2 m and 12 m corresponding to the understory and low canopy

Fig. 6. Boxplot of the acoustic amplitude recorded in the understory and in the canopy at each recording site and during the four time periods identiﬁed on the multidimensional analysis
(see Fig. 2). For each understory/canopy pair of recording a two-sided t-test for paired samples with unequal variances was computed. The signiﬁcance of the test is indicated with either
NS for non signiﬁcant or *** for a Bonferroni corrected p value lower than 0.001. The sign ‘b’ (respectively ‘N’) indicates that the understory amplitude level was lower (respectively higher)
than the canopy amplitude level when the t-test was signiﬁcant.

levels (Marten et al., 1977). Similar transmission tests in Venezuela did
not reveal advantageous acoustic conditions at the canopy level
(Ellinger and Hödl, 2003). A recent study undertaken in India with
Ensiferan insects showed that the canopy was not the best place for signal transmission but that the mid and upper understory (2 m and 4 m)
less degraded the signals produced (Jain and Balakrishnan, 2012). All
these data suggest that the canopy does not constitute a more favorable
acoustic environment, which could explain higher amplitude levels. The
second hypothesis regarding loudness has never been investigated, as
the sound pressure level of a series of species, which are difﬁcult to
approach in the canopy, requires documentation. The third hypothesis
would be supported by a high level of species richness and species density of animals, in particular arthropods, in the canopy (Allen, 1996;
Basset et al., 2003; Nadkarni, 1994; Shaw, 2004) potentially leading to
a higher acoustic intensity in the canopy than close to ground.
Tropical spatial community structure and dynamics reveal a high
level of horizontal heterogeneity within tropical landscapes (Carson
and Schnitzer, 2008). In particular, tree species diversity was found to
be highly heterogeneous at the Nouragues Research Station (Poncy
et al., 2001) and branch falls, tree falls and canopy gaps induced complex habitat and spatial landscape dynamics locally (Meer van der and
Bongers, 2001). We could detect here another layer of horizontal heterogeneity as both frequency and amplitude acoustic analyses
revealed signiﬁcant variation along the horizontal plane. In particular,
the north part showed the most important spectral barriers between
adjacent plots and the patch in the southeast part was characterized
by the highest amplitude values. The ecological processes beyond

these horizontal patterns are difﬁcult to identify but there are several
candidate factors that could shape soundscape dynamics: (1) vegetation
heterogeneity might induce different sound propagation environments
more or less suitable for an efﬁcient signal transfer; (2) the quality of
habitats and micro-habitats within the forest landscape in terms of
food resources might act as source-and-sink systems (Pulliam, 1988)
and lead to an excess or a deﬁcit of singing individuals; (3) speciﬁc
movement patterns of each species (stationary vs. different degrees
of mobility) within their habitat might induce speciﬁc spatial and temporal dynamics of the sound sources; and (4) the social and mating
systems of each species might a generate speciﬁc spatial pattern with
individual calling isolated, in dynamic leks or in pseudo or fully synchronized choruses.
5. Conclusion
Acoustic recording is a new remote sensing technique that can
provide complementary information on landscape structure, animal
ecology processes, and the local animal diversity state. We could detect
temporal and spatial heterogeneity in a small tropical forest area. However, this study, together with a previous study (Pekin et al., 2012),
should be considered as a very ﬁrst attempt to characterize the acoustic
complexity of tropical soundscapes. The heterogeneity and dynamics of
a tropical soundscape are probably the result of a complex net of
interacting processes that are still to be clearly identiﬁed. To understand
the diversity and variation of a tropical soundscape might be as difﬁcult
as deciphering tropical forest animal and plant patterns that have

now been studied for decades. Soundscape ecology is a promising
discipline for the study of tropical animal sound but this should not
discredit the species-speciﬁc approach. Here, we deﬁnitely need to go
down to an analysis of species-level acoustic ecology to better understand
the patterns that emerge at a landscape scale. In other words, both
behavioral and ecological approaches, led by bioacoustics and soundscape ecology respectively, are necessary. Finally, our study emphasizes
that tropical forests contain a very important and complex acoustic diversity that can be impaired with the rise of anthropic noise. Acoustic
diversity is a very valuable part of biodiversity that should be considered together with classical biodiversity facets, like species richness or
functional diversity, for tropical habitat preservation.
