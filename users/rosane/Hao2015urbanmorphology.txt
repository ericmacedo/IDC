The aim of this study is to determine how to increase birdsong loudness and the visibility of green areas in
low-density residential areas by controlling urban morphological parameters. The spatial sound level distributions of birdsong at 12 sites sampled from a GIS database of Assen, the Netherlands, were simulated
by noise mapping techniques and calculated using a MATLAB program on spatial sound level matrices.
The visibilities of green areas are analysed and calculated by Visibility Analysis Graph in Space Syntax.
Correlation analyses were conducted between the obtained data on spatial sound level indices, the mean
visibility and urban morphological parameters. The results show that birdsong loudness has signiﬁcant
positive linear relationships with urban morphological parameters, including Building Plan Area Fraction (R2 = 0.491), Green Area Perimeters (R2 = 0.491) and Green Area Dispersion Index (R2 = 0.618), while
the visibility of green area has negative linear relationships with morphological parameters, including
Building Plan Area Fraction (R2 = 0.431) and Green Area Perimeters (R2 = 0.799). It has also been found
that in the proximity of green areas, the visibility of green areas has a positive relationship with birdsong
loudness, whereas in most areas further from green areas, the visibility of green areas has a negative
relationship with birdsong loudness. Either increasing birdsong loudness or enhancing visibility of the
green areas by controlling urban morphological parameters is helpful for the optimisation of soundscape
design with masking effects. Bird habitats and vegetation are important ecological issues to consider for
the enhancement of the roles of urban morphology.

1. Introduction
Green areas are an important natural resource in urban areas
and can fulﬁl a variety of human needs, such as natural view (Lange,
Hehl-Lange, & Brewer, 2008), air quality (Currie & Bass, 2008),
microclimate (Shashua-Bar and Hoffma, 2000) and noise reduction
(Fang & Ling, 2003; Van Renterghem, Botteldooren, & Verheyen,
2012). Green areas therefore are signiﬁcant for quality of life and

have high social and economic values (Anderson & Cordell, 1988; De
Hollander & Staatsen, 2003; Kirkpatrick, Davison, & Daniels, 2012).
In terms of natural view, green areas have often been studied from
the perspectives of visibility (Yang, Zhao, Mcbride, & Gong, 2009),
aesthetics, recreation (Lange et al., 2008), safety and preference
(Jorgensen, Hitchmough, & Calvert, 2002) in urban life.
Green areas are also an important supplier of birdsong due
to their ecological function as habitats for birds and other animals (Hansson, 2000; Daniels & Kirkpatrick, 2006; Pellissier, Cohen,
Boulay, & Clergeau, 2012). Birds are one of the best-known biological groups in cities (Pellissier et al., 2012); thus, birdsong is a
frequent, distinct and frequency-adaptable natural sound source
in the ambient noise of urbanised areas (Ryan & Brenowitz, 1985;

150

Halfwerk and Slabbekoorn, 2009; Cardoso & Atwell, 2011). Birdsong is ranked at the top of the desired natural urban sounds
(Yang & Kang, 2005) and beneﬁts people’s rejuvenation and health
through its pleasantness (Gidlöf-Gunnarsson and Öhrström, 2007).
It also commonly interferes with trafﬁc noise in urban areas
(Best, Ozmeral, Gallun, Sen, & Shinn-Cunningham, 2005; GidlöfGunnarsson, Öhrström, & Ögren, 2007; Kang, 2007; Gold, 2010).
Recently, with the emergence of the ‘soundscape’ concept
(Zhang & Kang, 2007; Yu & Kang, 2009; Kang & Zhang, 2010;
Brown, Kang, & Gjestland, 2011), research on the urban sound
environment has been extended to perceptual assessment (Yang &
Kang, 2005; Kang, 2007; Joynt & Kang, 2010), where “masking” has
been employed to study the interference between natural sounds
and urban noise (Nilsson, Alvarsson, & Rådsten-Ekman, 2009; De
Coensel, Vanwetswinkel, & Botteldooren, 2011). Masking effects
also have been considered as an important urban design technique (Siebein, Kwon, Smitthakorn, & Gold, 2007). Masking, which
refers to a signiﬁcant everyday-life phenomenon in hearing (Yost,
2008), has been widely identiﬁed and investigated in terms of two
main categories:“energetic masking” and “informational masking”
(Nilsson et al., 2009; Durlach et al., 2003; Watson, 2005). Watson
(2005) deﬁned the interference among different sounds based only
on the physical properties of the sound as “energetic masking” and
the masking or interference caused by making the stimulus context variable and uncertain as “informational masking”. It has been
demonstrated that as a result of “energetic masking” and “informational masking”, either increasing birdsong loudness or enlarging
the visibility of green areas can signiﬁcantly improve the pleasantness and naturalness of the trafﬁc noise environment (Hao, 2014).
Therefore, the main motivation of this study is to determine how to
enhance the positive effects of masking for soundscape optimisation from these two perspectives, i.e., increasing birdsong loudness
and enlarging the visibility of green areas in urban design.
Urban morphology, which is at the root of urbanism and urban
design (Kropt, 2005; Larkham, 2005), has direct and substantial
impacts on both outdoor sound propagation (Raydan & Steemers,
2006; Kang, 2007) and space visibility (Yang et al., 2009; Sander
& Manson, 2007). In previous studies on urban environments
(e.g., solar potential, atmospheric environment and trafﬁc noise),
urban morphological factors, for example building density, building patterns, street layout and coverage and landscaping, have been
represented and studied using a number of quantitative urban morphological parameters (Cheng, Steemers, Montavon, & Compagnon,
2006; Xie, Huang, & Wang, 2006; Salomons & Pont, 2012). However,
there is a shortage of integrated research on green areas from the
perspectives of both birdsong loudness and visibility of green areas
in the context of urban morphology to suggest practical landscape
and urban design guidelines.
Therefore, this study aims at exploring the integrated effects
of urban morphological parameters that reﬂect the 3D nature of
green areas and buildings on birdsong loudness and visibility of
green areas. Correspondingly, this paper ﬁrst will show how urban
morphology inﬂuences these two aspects and then how the two
aspects are related.

which may result in masking effects between the two main sound
sources at the sites (i.e., trafﬁc noise and birdsong). In these areas,
the daytime trafﬁc noise is relatively constant; the sound levels
are typically 50–60 dBA, and most of the energy is between 100
and 1600 Hz. The green ratio of Assen City, including gardens and
forests, is approximate 36% according to ofﬁcial statistics released
by the Assen Municipality (2011), therefore the grids that have this
representative green ratio and main roads were randomly sampled.
Fig. 1 shows ﬁgure-ground maps of the 12 sampled sites, with the
buildings in black, roads in grey and green areas in light green.
2.2. Sound mapping of birdsong

2.1. Site sampling

To simulate the spatial distribution of birdsong sound levels, sound maps were calculated using a common noise-mapping
package, Cadna/A (DataKustik GmbH, 2006; Szulecki, Zwerling,
Anderson, & Turpin, 2010; McGowan, 2012). For noise mapping,
the propagation of the frequency components of birdsong was
calculated in the models. First, in the simulation, birdsong is emitted from green areas (250 m × 250 m) in eight idealised wild open
spaces (see Section 2.2.1); this is a pilot study of birdsong loudness
for the further study of birdsong in the actual urban morphology of
the sampled sites (see Section 2.2.2).
The representative heights of major bird habitats in urban trees
were used for the simulation sound source heights because in
town centres birds nest more in trees than on the ground or in
shrubbery, as is the case in the countryside. Approximately 70%
of Passeriformes nest higher than 4 m in the centres of European
towns (Clergeau, Croci, Jokimäki, Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki, & Dinetti,
2006). Tree nesters are considered to be better urban adaptors. The
increased planting of trees may provide more suitable nesting habitats for the tree nesting guild, further increasing their abundance
(Huhta, Jokimäki, & Rahko, 1999; Clergeau et al., 2006; Pellissier
et al., 2012).
Patch size and its inﬂuence on avian habitats are also important
issues to consider in the modelling because the green areas are
composed of patches of different sizes in both idealised wide open
spaces and the morphology of the study sites. Patch sizes in idealised open spaces vary from 0.28 to 2.25 ha, and the patch sizes in
the actual urban morphology are 0.1 to 2.02 ha, except for one patch
with an area of 0.06 ha. The effects of patch size on avian density and
nesting are debated; it has been suggested that they are not clearly
inﬂuenced by patch size but vary among regions, number of years
of vegetation and species (Winter, Johnson, Sharffer, Donovan, &
Svedarsky, 2006; Davis, 2004; Schmiegelow & Mönkkönen, 2002;
Schieck, Lertzman, Nyberg, & Page, 1995; Andrén, 1994; Van Dorp
& Opdam, 1987). However, Van Dorp and Opdam (1987) utilised
0.1 ha as a lower limit for the habitat of birds and proved that multiple bird species inhabited patches of 0.1 ha. Moreover, roads in
the residential areas in Assen are primarily two-lane without a
disturbed roadside, so they are not considered as patch barriers
(Winter et al., 2006). Birds in the small patches can still use the
resources of the neighbouring patches (Andrén, 1994). Therefore,
although there is a risk that birds may not inhabit the small patches,
for this study it was assumed that the fragmentation of the green
areas has little inﬂuence on avian density in the same region and
with similar vegetation and avian species. Given the same green
area ratio, the number of birds in each site was set as a constant
parameter to compare the effects of urban morphology.

The study sites were sampled in Assen, which is the capital city
of the province of Drenthe. Assen can be regarded as a typical European town with diverse low-density urban morphologies and trafﬁc
characteristics (Hao & Kang, 2013). Using a GIS database with 763
grids (each 250 m × 250 m) of the built-up areas of Assen, approximately 51% of the grids have both the trafﬁc arboreal green areas,

2.2.1. Idealised wide open spaces
To initially examine the inﬂuence of geometric conﬁgurations of
green areas and distributions of sound sources on birdsong loudness without sound obstacles (e.g., buildings), eight idealised wild
open spaces were simulated. The open spaces have a consistent
green ratio of 36%, which is a control parameter in the sound

mapping. The ratio is the same as the green ratio of Assen, as mentioned above. The geometric conﬁgurations of the green areas are
abstracted from the commonly seen design of green areas in the
residential communities in the Assen GIS database. Birdsong may
attenuate less rapidly at an intermediate “frequency window” from
1600 to 2500 Hz, particularly in long-range communication in lowforest habitats (Morton, 1975), the birdsong was initially simulated
using a song band source at a representative frequency of 2000 Hz
and a representative habitat height of 4 m. Fig. 2 shows the sound
maps of the birdsong emitted from the eight green areas.
The distribution of sound sources, i.e., where birdsongs are emitted in the green areas, is a substantial issue in the simulation.
Because of the effects of edges on bird habitats (e.g., feeding, foraging, and nest selection), as noted in several studies (Hansson, 1994;
D McCollin, 1998; Huhta et al., 1999), and because deciduous trees
are most widely planted in green areas and along the local streets
in Assen (Gemeente Assen, 2006, 2009), sources that are localised
on the boundaries of green areas were considered along with uniformly distributed sources throughout the green areas. Therefore,
as shown in Fig. 2, four different types of sound source distributions
were examined, including an idealised situation of full distribution
of sound sources in rectangular arrays (RF), random distribution of
50% sound sources in rectangular arrays (RR), full distribution of
sound sources along green area boundaries (BF), and a random distribution of 50% sound sources along green area boundaries (BR).
For the two types of full distributions, RF and BF, the tree spacing
was 10 m × 10 m. To make the 4 types comparable, the total sound
energy of birdsong of RF was the same as that of BF, based on the

assumption that a same size of green area affords a same bird population. Receivers in a rectangular array of 5 m × 5 m were placed
to obtain the sound levels of birdsong outside of the green areas at
each site in the simulations.
Fig. 3 shows the percentage of the areas at different sound levels of birdsong in the eight idealised open spaces. Although the
total birdsong energy and green area ratio are the same for the
eight open spaces, certain geometric conﬁgurations have more
area with louder birdsong than others. For example, as shown in
Fig. 3b and d, when examining the RF (Rectangular array, full distribution of birdsong), 25.6% of the area in Pattern D-1 has 68 dB
birdsong and only 10.1% of the area in Pattern B has 68 dB birdsong. It is also important to note that in general, the four types
of sound source distributions of each pattern have rather similar
distribution curves (see Fig. 3), which indicates that the geometric conﬁgurations of the green areas rather than the distributions
of individual sound sources may inﬂuence the spatial distribution
forms of birdsong sound levels outside of the green areas, even
when the density of sound sources is reduced by half by random
sampling. Therefore, in accordance with Adolphe’s study (2001) on
the model of urban morphology, wherein ‘useful area’ is deﬁned
as an element in highly mineral urban spaces from the perspective
of the environmental performance to simplify the parameterisation of vegetation and bodies of water, the green areas in this study
can also be studied as an integrated component with a ‘circumscribed cylinder’ shape (Adolphe, 2001) composed of vegetation
and birds in an urban morphology, without particular attention to
the distributions of individual sound sources and as demonstrated

by the results. Homogenisation effects of urbanisation on biological
communities are also an important reason for the hypothesis.
It can also be seen in Fig. 3a and b, that in Patterns A and B, more
areas have high sound levels of birdsong when birdsong energy is
emitted entirely from the boundaries. For example, 10.5% of the
area has 71 dB birdsong in Pattern A when it is BF, but this value
is only 3.0% when it is RF. The reason might be that Patterns A and
B have smaller green area perimeters, therefore the sound level
of birdsong per meter is higher than the other six patterns under
the condition of the same total amount of sound energy, which
results in more peak sound levels in proximity to the green area.
As green area perimeter increases, this effect of peak sound levels
is generally decreased, as shown in Fig. 3c–f and h.

Therefore, in the present study of birdsong in the actual urban
morphology of the sample sites, the geometric characteristics of
green areas rather than the types of sound source distribution are
the principal factors examined. The total sound energy of birdsong
was set to a constant value based on the assumption that a same
size of green area affords a same bird population.
2.2.2. Actual urban morphology
In the sound mapping of birdsong in the actual urban morphology, the 3D information of the sampled sites that can be converted
into vector maps in Cadna/A was obtained from a GIS database of
Assen from TOP10NL of Kadaster (2008). The conditions of building façades and ground were gained from the in-situ investigation

and Google Maps. Because the study is more a parameter study on
urban morphology, to make the analysis results comparable, the
sound sources are all localised along the green area boundaries with
a constant distance of 10 m between two trees and emit the same
total amount of sound energy of birdsong in each site. The ground
absorption was set to 0 outside of green areas and 0.6 inside the
green areas.
Great tit (Parus major), common blackbird (Turdus merula)
and sparrow (Passer) are the three common urban passerine bird communities found in Assen. The energy of the
birdsong of the three communities concentrates in the frequency range of 2000 to 8000 Hz (Franco & Slabbekoorn, 2009;
Pohl, Leadbeater, Slabbekoorn, Klump, & Langemann, 2012;
Nemeth et al., 2013; Schmidt, Moore, MacDougall-Shackleton, &
MacDougall-Shackleton, 2013), and the frequencies between 2000
and 8000 Hz are especially impacted by the shape, material and
height of noise barriers between the noise source and bird breeding
habitat (Slabbeckoorn & Ripmeester, 2008). Therefore, the birdsong
was simulated as single-band sound sources at three representative
frequencies, i.e., 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz. There are two main reasons for the generic setting of the birdsong frequencies. First, the
homogenisation effects of urbanisation has altered the composition of biological communities (Turner, Nakamura, & Dinetti, 2004;
Marzluff, 2001) and increased species similarity (Blair, 2001). In
European cities, heterogeneity of avifauna species in towns is low,
especially in the centre, indicating simple urban bird communities and the replacement of specialist species by generalist species
(Clergeau et al., 2006; Pellissier et al., 2012). Second, urban noise
has caused a reduction in avian species richness and the adaption
of birdsong to higher frequencies (Francis, Ortega, & Cruz1, 2009;
Pohl et al., 2012; Nemeth et al., 2013).
As mentioned above, because the building heights are primarily between 8 and 10 m, the birdsong sources are set to two
representative heights in trees in the sites: 4 m (lower than the

typical building height) and 10 m (higher than the typical building
height); sound reﬂections by buildings with these two conditions
can be compared. Fig. 4 shows sound maps of birdsong at 4000 Hz
with a sound source height of 4 m, for example.
It is also important to model how urban morphology can impact
birdsong distribution when there are fewer birds (as there might
be under different ecological environments, e.g., vegetation and climate); therefore the modelled number of birds was reduced to 1/2
and 1/4 of the initial setting.
2.3. Selection and calculation of urban morphological parameters
To quantitatively compare diverse urban textures, urban
morphological parameters have been explored, developed and
employed in studies of environmental performance, landscape,
land use, atmospheric and wind environment (Xie et al., 2006;
Adolphe, 2001; Esbah, 2009; Ng, Yuan, Chen, Ren, & Fung, 2011;
Van de Voorde, Jacquet, & Canters, 2011). The urban morphological parameters that might be related to birdsong distribution and
view of green area have been selected and developed from the perspective of possible effects of urban morphology on outdoor sound
propagation (e.g., distance and ground, barrier and canyon effects)
and urban view block. The parameters can indicate the characteristics of plot and street pattern, ground and building surface
condition and building (barrier) geometry (Kang, 2007; Raydan
& Steemers, 2006; Stamps, 2001). Seven quantitative parameters
were used in this study: Building Plan Area Fraction (BPAF), Complete Aspect Ratio (CAR), Building Surface Area to Plan Area Ratio
(BSAPAR), First-row Building Frontal Length Index (FBFLI), Distance of First-row Building to Green Area (DFBGA), Green Area
Perimeter (GAP), and Green Area Dispersion Index (GADI). The ﬁrst
three parameters are for 2D and 3D characterisations of buildings,
the fourth and ﬁfth characterise the relative locations between
buildings and green areas, and the last two parameters are for the

More than 70% of the residential buildings in Assen are low-rise
terraced and detached buildings with heights primarily between
8 and 10 m (Kadaster, 2008). Table 1 shows the formulas for the
calculation of the urban morphological parameters.
2.4. Matlab processing
The RGB raster sound maps of the 12 sites are transformed into
matrices of spatial sound level values in dB to obtain the spatial
sound level indices by a Matlab program developed for this study
(Hao & Kang, 2013). For each case, all of the spatial sound level values at each site are ranked in descending order. The spatial sound
level indices of Ln , include Lmax , L10 , L20 , L30 , L40 , L50 , L60 , L70 , L80 ,
L90 and Lmin , where Ln speciﬁes one certain sound level value at the
position of n% in all of the descending values. For example, L10 is
the value located at the top 10% in the rankings of all of the spatial
noise level values, Lmax means the highest value in the ranking, and
Lmin means the lowest value (Wang & Kang, 2011). Lavg is used to
indicate the mean of all of the spatial noise levels of a given site. To
investigate the birdsong environments both indoors and outdoors,
the spatial sound level values on building façades and in open areas
were processed separately. In this study the green areas were studied as integrated components that impact birdsong distribution in
the spaces outside of green areas, so the spatial sound levels within
the green areas were excluded.
2.5. Space syntax for visibility
To evaluate the visibilities of green areas at the sites, Visibility Graphs were calculated with a commonly used Open Source
application, UCL Depthmap, which performs visibility analysis of
architectural and urban systems under a theory of Space Syntax
related to spatial cognition (Jiang & Claramunt, 2002; Bafna, 2003;
Turner, 2003; Hillier, 2012). Visibility Graphs can analyse how
much any one point in a spatial network is currently visible from

both Axial Maps and Visibility Graph Analysis (VGA) with observed
ﬂow in central London, which shows that the measure of visibility by Visibility Graph Analysis performed signiﬁcantly better than
the Axial Map measures. Therefore, in this study, the visibility of
the green areas of each site was measured as the mean value of
visual connectivity in VGA. The seed points were spaced on all of
the green areas with a 5 m × 5 m gird, with vector plans of the sites
at an eye level of 1.6 m. The connectivity of each location refers to
how many locations each node can directly see (Turner, 2004), and
the value ranges of connectivity vary widely depending on the site
situation analysed (e.g., area size and obstacle).
3. Results
This section addresses three issues: (1) what are the characteristics of birdsong distribution in the actual urban morphology; (2)
how do the urban morphological parameters inﬂuence audibility
of birdsong and visibility of green areas; (3) does visibility of green
areas have any relationship to birdsong loudness.
3.1. Birdsong loudness in actual urban morphology
Fig. 5 shows the mean sound levels of birdsong of the 12 sampled sites at 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz in terms of spatial sound
level indices of L10 , L50 , L90 and Lavg , where it can be seen that
the mean sound levels are 1–4 dB higher when the sound sources
are 4 m high than at 10 m for L10 , L50 or Lavg , in both open areas
and on facades, while for L90 , the mean sound levels in open areas
are 0–2 dB higher when the height is 10 m. Therefore, to generally increase the birdsong loudness in low-density residential areas,
the species of tree-dwelling birds that have lower habitats are preferred, whereas to raise the birdsong loudness in areas far from
green areas, birds with more elevated habitats are preferred.
Different urban morphologies indeed induce different spatial
birdsong distributions, as indicated by the standard deviations of

the spatial sound level indices among the sampled sites in Fig. 6.
The spatial sound level indices L70 , L80 and L90 have higher variations than the other indices at 2000 and 4000 Hz, both on façades
and in open areas, as shown in Fig. 6, which means spatial sound
level distributions of birdsong are more sensitive to urban morphology at 2000 and 4000 Hz in relatively quiet areas. The largest
variation occurs at L80 at 4000 Hz in open areas when sound sources
are 4 m high, with a standard deviation as 7.2 dB, followed by L90 at
2000 Hz in open areas (6.6 dB) (see Fig. 6). The standard deviations
of the indices for louder birdsong areas (e.g., L20 , L30 , L40 and L50 )
at 8000 Hz are larger than those at 2000 and 4000 Hz (see Fig. 6),
especially for a height of 4 m; this may be because building barrier effects are crucial for the attenuation of high frequency sound
components at shorter distances, which increases the inﬂuence of
urban morphology on the birdsong environment in the proximity
of green areas.
It is also important to note that the spatial sound level distribution on façades and in open areas shows different characteristics
from the perspective of variation (see Fig. 6a–d), although their
differences of mean values of the indices are not large in Fig. 5.
Accordingly, this study will further investigate birdsong attenuation from the viewpoints of both façades and open areas, which
concerns not only indoor birdsong from green areas but also the
incidence of birdsong in open space.
When the number of birds is reduced to 1/2 or 1/4, the spatial sound levels are all reduced by 3 or 6 dB when the birdsong
propagates in the same site. The standard deviations of the spatial
sound levels are the same as those of the full number of birds, which
means the impacts of urban morphology on birdsong distribution
remain constant, and the rules still work when the number of birds

is reduced. However, the perceived loudness of birdsong may be
signiﬁcantly reduced when the spatial sound levels are reduced by
6 dB.
3.2. Relationships with urban morphological parameters
The values of the seven urban morphological parameters of the
sampled sites were ﬁrst calculated according to the formulas in
Table 1. In general, the values of each parameter evenly distribute
in the ranges (see Table 1), indicating a quantitative diversity of the
urban morphologies of the sites within the ranges.
3.2.1. Birdsong loudness
To investigate whether and how the spatial sound level distribution of birdsong is related to urban morphology, a correlation
analysis was conducted between urban morphological parameters
and the indices of L60 , L70 , L80 and L90 , which have higher variations, as shown in Fig. 6. Table 2 shows the R-squared values of the
linear regressions between the parameters and indices, which have
signiﬁcant bivariate correlations (p < 0.05, two tailed). The results
show that the spatial sound level indices are related to the urban
morphological parameters. The indices are more correlated to the
parameters when the sound sources are at a height of 4 m than
when the sources are a height of 10 m (see Table 2). It is not surprising that the indices at 8000 Hz are more strongly correlated
than at 2000 and 4000 Hz because building barrier effects play a
more signiﬁcant role on attenuation at the relatively high frequency
components of birdsong.
The parameters for the characteristics of green areas (i.e., GAP
and GADI) have stronger correlations with the spatial sound level

distribution of birdsong than those for the characteristics of buildings (BPAF, CAR and BSAPAR) and for the relative locations between
buildings and green areas (FBFLI and DFBGA), which means that the
geometry of a green area has the largest inﬂuence on birdsong propagation in low-density residential urban morphology. Fig. 7 further
shows two examples of the relationships between the indices and
urban morphological parameters and green areas. In the range 869
to 2340 m, when Green Area Perimeter increases, L60 at 8000 Hz
constantly increases, and the differences among the sites are rather
large (i.e., 11 dB) (see Fig. 7a); even the Green Ratios of the sites are

constant. L70 at 8000 Hz increases with an increase of Green Area
Dispersion Index in the range 10.1 to 18.6, and the value differences
of L70 are up to 10 dB (see Fig. 7b). In conclusion, to enhance the
birdsong loudness in a site with a certain Green Ratio, it is important to segment green areas, increase the boundary lengths of green
areas, and scatter green areas throughout the whole site.
Building Plan Area Fraction, which refers only to 2D building information, is the most signiﬁcant building-related parameter
according to the correlation analysis in Table 2. Fig. 8 shows the positive relationships between the indices and BPAF in a range from 0.1

to 0.2, indicating that the reﬂections of birdsong by buildings are
crucial for increasing birdsong loudness in relatively quiet areas.

3.2.2. Visibility of green areas
The results of the mean visibility of green areas of the sampled
sites widely and evenly cover a range of 88.9 to 710.3. A bivariate
correlation study was also conducted that compared the visibility
of green areas with respect to urban morphological parameters. The
results show that the visibility is signiﬁcantly correlated to Building
Plan Area Fraction (p = 0.020), Building Surface Area to Plan Area
Ratio (p = 0.043) and Green Area Perimeter (p = 0.000). In accordance with the analysis results on birdsong and urban morphology,
the parameters on the relative locations between buildings and
green areas (FBFLI and DFBGA) have little inﬂuence on visibility
of green area. Unsurprisingly, the visibility of green area decreases
when BPAF increases (see Fig. 9a), which means sites with lower
building density have higher visibility of green areas. As shown
in Fig. 9b, another important parameter is Green Area Perimeter,
which has a rather signiﬁcant negative relationship with the visibility of green areas because the segmenting of green areas may
enhance the effects of view block by buildings.
It is important to notice that, in contrast to the positive relations between birdsong loudness in relatively quiet areas and urban
morphological parameters, the signiﬁcant relations between the
visibility of green areas and the three correlated parameters are all
negative. Hence, in practical designs, the control of the parameters
in this study almost entirely depends on which aspect is the main
concern.

3.3. Relationship between visibility of green areas and birdsong
loudness
To examine possible relationships between visibility of green
areas and spatial sound level distribution of birdsong, an analysis
was performed (Table 3). It can be seen that the mean visibility has
signiﬁcant correlations (p < 0.050, 2 tailed) with spatial sound level
indices of birdsong primarily at 4 m, both on façades and in open
areas; when the height is 10 m, the signiﬁcant correlations merely
exist at 8000 Hz. Compared to the 2000 Hz frequency, the 4000
and 8000 Hz frequencies have more signiﬁcant correlations (see
Table 3), which means that the visibility of green area is more correlated to the sound propagation of higher frequency components
of birdsong.
The visibility of green areas is much less correlated to the indices
for relatively quiet areas, i.e., L70 , L80 and L90 , which indicates that
the sites with higher visibility of green area may not have necessarily quieter birdsong than the areas far from the green areas
(see Table 3). The linear regression analysis results show an interesting phenomenon between visibility and birdsong propagation.
The visibility has positive relations to the indices that represent
sound levels in the proximity of green areas (i.e., Lmax and L10 ) and
negative relations to the other indices (i.e., L20 , L30 , L40 , L50 , L60
and Lmin ), as shown by the examples in Fig. 10. This means that
the more visible green areas are, the louder birdsong in proximity
of green areas is compared to most of the areas that are further
away. From the viewpoint of urban morphology, the reason for this
phenomenon is that buildings close to green areas play important
roles as both sound barriers and view block, but buildings further
from green areas, which still block the view of green areas, are

primarily sound reﬂectors rather than sound barriers; this
enhances the audibility of birdsong in the relatively quiet areas,
in accordance with the results in Section 3.2.1.
4. Discussion
Based on actual situations of birdsong and trafﬁc noise in Assen,
parallel lab experiments have been conducted to investigate the
impact of the acoustic characteristics of the two sounds on the
masking effects (Hao, 2014). The results show that when birdsong loudness increases, the masking effects of birdsong become
more signiﬁcant, the naturalness and pleasantness of the soundscape increase, and annoyance decreases. The study also shows
that occurrence frequency of birdsong is a signiﬁcant factor that
inﬂuences masking effects. As the occurrence frequency of birdsong
increases, the soundscape quality increases continuously (Hao,
2014), so it is also meaningful to attract bird species that chirp more
frequently to inhabit the areas.
The ecology of bird habitat and vegetation structure is the bases
for the study of birdsong distribution. The ecological issues, such
as patch size, bird density, effects of surrounding noise and habitat
height, can be seen in this study. For example, to generally enhance
birdsong loudness over a whole site in an actual urban area, species
of tree birds that live in lower habitats are preferred because it
has been demonstrated that with either L10 , L50 or Lavg the mean
sound levels at all of the sampled sites are 1–4 dB higher when
the sound sources are 4 m high (lower than the surrounding buildings at 8–10 m) than those at 10 m. Additionally, compared to 10 m,
when the height of sound source is 4 m, urban morphology has a

greater impact on birdsong loudness in the low-density residential areas. Green areas can be studied as integrated components for
their birdsong emissions, and the impacts of urban morphology on
birdsong propagation are not reduced by a reduction of bird density
in one region in a certain range.
The urban morphological parameters do have effects on both
birdsong loudness and the visibility of green areas. In terms of the
2D geometric conﬁguration of green areas, at 8000 Hz and with
Green Area Perimeter increasing from 869 to 2340 m, the sound
levels of birdsong in the areas further from green areas can be
increased by up to 11 dB; with a Green Area Dispersion Index that
increases from 10.11 to 18.62, the sound levels can go up by 10 dB.
However, the sites with higher Green Area Perimeters have a lower
visibility of green areas. Therefore, for a given Green Ratio, segmenting green areas, increasing boundary lengths of green areas
and scattering green areas throughout the whole site can increase
birdsong loudness and reduce the visibility of green areas. In terms
of building characteristics, Building Plan Area Fraction is the most
important urban morphological parameter for the audibility of
birdsong. It is possible to increase the sound level of 8000 Hz birdsong at L70 up to 12 dB in open areas and up to 10 dB on façades
by increasing the Building Plan Area Fraction from 0.10 to 0.21.
However, in accordance with the Green Area Perimeter, sites with
higher Building Plan Area Fractions have lower green area visibility; Mean Visibility decreases from 710.3 to 88.9. The parameters
for the relative locations between buildings and green areas, i.e.,
Building Frontal Length Index and Distance of First-row Building
to Green Area, have little inﬂuence on either birdsong loudness or
green area visibility.
In a parallel study (Hao, 2014), it was also demonstrated that
visibility of green areas can enhance the masking effects through
aural-visual interaction. In this study, it has been shown that in
areas further from green areas, urban morphology that has higher
green area visibility has lower birdsong loudness due to the reduction of sound reﬂected by the buildings. Therefore, “informational
masking” in the visual context can play an important role on the
masking effects by compensating for the reduced “energetic masking” in these areas.

Additionally, the masking effects of birdsong are more efﬁcient when the road trafﬁc noise environment is relatively low, i.e.
approximately 50 dBA (Hao, 2014). Therefore, to optimise soundscape design, in addition to increasing the loudness and occurrence
frequency of birdsong, attenuating the trafﬁc noise level is essential.

5. Conclusions
This study explores how urban morphology inﬂuences the incidence of green area from the perspective of audibility of birdsong
and visibility of green areas in meso-scale, low-density residential areas. Seven urban morphological parameters that are related
to building characteristics, the relative locations of buildings and
green areas, and characteristics of green areas were deﬁned. Noise
mapping techniques and Visibility Graph Analysis in Space Syntax
were employed to analyse the sampled sites with diverse urban
morphologies.
The results show that birdsong loudness has signiﬁcant, positive
linear relationships with urban morphological parameters, including Building Plan Area Fraction (R2 = 0.491), Green Area Perimeters
(R2 = 0.491) and Green Area Dispersion Index (R2 = 0.618), while
visibility of green area has negative linear relationships with
morphological parameters, including Building Plan Area Fraction
(R2 = 0.431) and Green Area Perimeters (R2 = 0.799). It was also
found that in the proximity of green areas, the visibility of green
areas has positive relationships with birdsong loudness, whereas
in most areas further from green areas, the visibility of green areas
has a negative relationship with birdsong loudness.
To conclude, controlling the urban morphological parameters
(e.g., Green Area Perimeter and Building Plan Area Fraction) is an
efﬁcient and integrated implementation measure to optimise the

sonic and visual environment of birdsong. The masking effects of
birdsong can be considered as a design technique in terms of both
“energetic masking” and “informational masking” in the soundscape. Meanwhile, it is crucial to carefully consider the ecology of
bird habitat and vegetation to enhance the role of urban morphology on birdsong loudness and the visibility of green areas.
