The Convention on Biological Diversity’s strategic plan lays out ﬁve goals: “(A) address the underlying
causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society; (B) reduce the
direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use; (C) improve the status of biodiversity by
safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity; (D) enhance the beneﬁts to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services; (E) enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge
management and capacity building.” To meet and inform on the progress towards these goals, a globally coordinated approach is needed for biodiversity monitoring that is linked to environmental data
and covers all biogeographic regions. During a series of workshops and expert discussions, we identiﬁed nine requirements that we believe are necessary for developing and implementing such a global
terrestrial species monitoring program. The program needs to design and implement an integrated

information chain from monitoring to policy reporting, to create and implement minimal data standards and common monitoring protocols to be able to inform Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), and
to develop and optimize semantics and ontologies for data interoperability and modelling. In order to
achieve this, the program needs to coordinate diverse but complementary local nodes and partnerships.
In addition, capacities need to be built for technical tasks, and new monitoring technologies need to be
integrated. Finally, a global monitoring program needs to facilitate and secure funding for the collection
of long-term data and to detect and ﬁll gaps in under-observed regions and taxa. The accomplishment of
these nine requirements is essential in order to ensure data is comprehensive, to develop robust models,
and to monitor biodiversity trends over large scales. A global terrestrial species monitoring program will
enable researchers and policymakers to better understand the status and trends of biodiversity.

Introduction
The Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD’s) Strategic Plan
for Biodiversity 2011–2020 envisages that “by 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining
ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering
beneﬁts essential for all people”. Although 193 parties have
adopted these goals, there is little infrastructure in place to collect the biodiversity information necessary to monitor progress
towards the objectives of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity
(http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/). Current international conservation policy requires biodiversity data to be current, reliable,
comparable among sites, relevant, and understandable, as is
becoming obvious from the work plan adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
(IPBES: http://www.ipbes.net/; http://tinyurl.com/ohdnknq) and
from recent assessments of the international biodiversity targets
(Butchart et al. 2010; Tittensor et al. 2014). Coordinated large-scale
biodiversity monitoring linked to environmental data is needed for
a comprehensive Global Observation Network that can meet the
ﬁve strategic goals of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and its 20
accompanying Aichi Targets for 2020. This is the main motivation of
the biodiversity axes of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (Christian 2005), which includes the Group of Earth
Observation’s Biodiversity Observation Network of the (GEO BON;
Scholes et al. 2012).
The ultimate goal of a global biodiversity monitoring network is
the timely delivery of adequate and defensible biodiversity data to
inform conservation policy, using robust indicators to demonstrate
the state of biodiversity, pressures on it, and responses to those
pressures (Chiarucci et al. 2011). Biodiversity can be quantiﬁed at
different levels of biological organization (i.e. from the molecular
to the ecosystem level), but species diversity and abundance still
represent the most intuitive and widely used measures of biodiversity (Butchart et al. 2010; Colwell & Coddington 1994; Tittensor
et al. 2014). That is because these two measures are both ecological
and evolutionary measures and strongly positively correlated with
other levels of biodiversity organization, such as genetic diversity
and ecosystem functioning (Pereira & Cooper 2006).
Any local monitoring program should acknowledge that monitoring data need to be collated at different scales, including the
global scale, to be able to inform about trends, status and changes of
biodiversity and to have a representative overview of environmental gradients in different areas of the world and for all taxonomic
groups (Collen et al. 2011). For these purposes, monitoring standards would need to be followed and data harmonization is needed
to allow easy data collation from different data sources. Aggregation is important because changes in individual species or sites are
often only symptoms of regional or global changes, whilst a global
monitoring scheme needs to consider the larger context (Collen
et al. 2011). GEO BON has adopted these goals (Scholes et al. 2012)
and has established an international group of experts to develop a

global monitoring network. Within this initiative, one of the working groups of GEO BON aims to develop a global terrestrial species
monitoring program (Pereira et al. 2010a).
Monitoring programs should be aware that data need to be condensed into summaries and indicators that are understandable by
multiple user groups and useful for policy development (e.g. the
Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
(IPBES), the European Platform for Biodiversity Research Strategy
(EPBRS), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), etc.), but also made
available to research to address conservation questions across geographic and temporal scales (Henle et al. 2014; Magnusson et al.
2013).
GEO BON is closely cooperating with regional biodiversity
observation networks (i.e. Arctic BON, EU BON, Asia-Paciﬁc BON) to
develop a framework to form a basis for global biodiversity monitoring focused on a set of ecologically relevant variables known as
Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) (Pereira et al. 2013). These
EBVs act as an intermediate, integrative layer between indicators
and raw biodiversity data. They allow for the averaging of trends
of multiple species across multiple locations, and their measurement captures ongoing changes in the status of biodiversity. The
EBVs can serve as a framework for biodiversity data integration
by identifying how variables should be sampled and measured, by
helping observation communities harmonize monitoring efforts,
and by providing useful summary statistics of changes in biodiversity (Pereira et al. 2013).
One motivation for pursuing the EBV framework is to align disparate monitoring efforts with a community-derived set of priority
measures. By identifying which variables should be monitored and
providing the necessary guidelines for sampling and data recording,
the EBVs are the ﬁrst step in setting a framework for biodiversity
data integration and modelling. This is of particular importance,
as we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity responses to change, especially at global scales (Lenoir et al.
2010; Pereira et al. 2012). Although it is possible to detect the
response of some taxa to drivers of change at regional scales (e.g.
birds and butterﬂies in Europe: Devictor et al. 2012; Thomas et al.
2004), most of the knowledge of response mechanisms or processes that is used to construct and parameterize more mechanistic
process-based predictive models is from studies conducted at very
local scales. Local measures of biodiversity responses are usually
extrapolated to larger scales with the assumption that species will
respond equally across their range (Henle et al. 2014). However,
species response mechanisms can differ locally due to complex
biotic and abiotic interactions (Gilman et al. 2010; Tylianakis et al.
2011) and therefore produce spatially heterogeneous patterns of
a response to changes (e.g. along an elevation or latitudinal gradient: Chen et al. 2011; Devictor et al. 2012) as well as in community
composition and turn-over (e.g. decline of ‘cold’ specialist species
versus increase in ‘warm’ generalist species: Devictor et al. 2012;
Julliard et al. 2006).

Fig. 1. The steps from ‘local and national’ to ‘regional’ to ‘global’ scale biodiversity monitoring. Data from the different scales need to be integrated and curated across scales.
These global datasets will be processed by GEO BON Terrestrial Species, modelled, and used to inform EBVs and key indicators. The resulting reports will then be disseminated
to important stakeholders on a global scale.

One goal of a global terrestrial species monitoring scheme
under GEO BON is to foster effective coordination among
existing monitoring programs. This is because biodiversity
monitoring has historically lacked coordination and integration (Marsh & Trenham 2008; Schmeller 2008). There
are many different initiatives that collectively could make a
greater contribution to global biodiversity monitoring than
can the sum of their individual parts, but currently do not.
Each of the following types of programs could potentially
contribute to this goal: (i) short-term monitoring programs
targeted at impact assessment and mitigation (e.g. GLOBE:
http://ecotope.org/projects/globe/), (ii) long-term study sites
and networks that monitor a suite of organisms (e.g. Long-term
Ecological Research (LTER), the National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON), the Tropical Ecology Assessment & Monitoring
network (TEAM)), (iii) programs organized by taxa (e.g. North
American and European breeding bird surveys, butterﬂy monitoring programs, species-speciﬁc monitoring programs), (iv)
regional, state and national systematic inventory and monitoring programs (e.g. inventories of trees and vascular plants
by national forest and park services, and the New Zealand
Department of Conservation’s Biodiversity Monitoring and
Reporting System, http://tinyurl.com/k5en8ws), and (v) citizen
science monitoring initiatives (e.g. Global Amphibian Bio-Blitz:
http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/global-amphibian-bioblitz;
a Ver Aves: http://averaves.org/; Great Backyard Bird Count:
http://gbbc.birdcount.org/; see also Donnelly et al. 2013; Schmeller
et al. 2009; Fig. 1).
Since 2009, the GEO BON working group on terrestrial species
monitoring has conducted a range of workshops, teleconferences,
and expert discussions to elaborate on the best ways to develop a
global terrestrial species monitoring scheme. Here we present the
outcome of these efforts and identify nine requirements that are
important for the successful implementation of a global terrestrial
species monitoring program.

Designing and implementing an integrated information chain
from monitoring to policy reporting
A global terrestrial species monitoring program should coordinate and integrate global data and metadata collection, survey
design (both sampling strategies and ﬁeld protocols), data storage
and access, computation and modelling of biodiversity indicators,
and dissemination of policy-relevant reports in a comprehensive
framework (Fig. 1). This integrated approach is required precisely
because many previous attempts to coordinate biodiversity monitoring schemes have failed (for the European monitoring landscape,
see Schmeller 2008). Moreover, many previous biodiversity monitoring schemes have been limited by poor survey design, lack of
data interoperability, inadequate plans for data storage and quality
assessment, and lack of alignment between data and policy information needs (e.g. Yoccoz et al. 2001).
Capacity-building to create a comprehensive spatial monitoring
program
GEO BON Terrestrial Species will need to involve citizens,
supported by professionals, to collect data, compute indicators,
interpret trends, and implement policy. However, current monitoring efforts are very unevenly distributed geographically (Amano
& Sutherland 2013; Martin et al. 2012) and are biased towards
particular taxa (Schmeller et al. 2009). Capacity building and
standardized infrastructure are most critical in regions that have
difﬁcult access (Magnusson et al. 2013:20). These information
gaps in regard to geographic, temporal and especially taxonomic
coverage, are well illustrated by the data used to report on the
Wild Bird Index (e.g. Butchart et al. 2010), the Living Planet Index
(Collen et al. 2008), the distribution of range-expanding species
such as invasives (McGeoch et al. 2010), and the distribution
of ecological ﬁeld studies, including the network of LTER sites
Martin et al. 2012; Metzger et al. 2010). The mismatch between

54

D.S. Schmeller et al. / Journal for Nature Conservation 25 (2015) 51–57

where biodiversity is most abundant and diverse (the tropical
regions) and where expertise and capacity is concentrated (the
temperate zones) leaves research and policy largely uninformed
about the status and trends of a large proportion of biodiversity. This includes targeting particular priority attributes or taxa,
such as sites or species experiencing rapid species range contractions and expansions. There are tools that can aggregate and
add value to local-scale monitoring programs by demonstrating
broader-scale patterns (Arnquist & Wooster 1995; Karl et al. 2013).
Monitoring efforts should encompass both range-expanding and
range-contracting species (Gaston 2011). Capacity building in tropical regions is a major challenge, and GEO BON will facilitate this
process by transferring expertise via training with lessons taken
from existing research projects (e.g. BIOTA: Jürgens et al. 2012;
PPBio (http://ppbio.inpa.gov.br/en/home): Magnusson et al. 2013)
and fellowship programs (e.g. the Zoological Society of London’s
EDGE, or the Conservation Leadership program).
A further challenge for capacity building in large-scale and
long-term biodiversity monitoring is the management of Big Data
(Hampton et al. 2013; Lacher et al. 2012). Although the collection,
storage, and curation of monitoring data might remain decentralized, data processing, indicator development and policy-relevant
reports are scale-dependent with regard to administrative, geographic, taxonomic and temporal scales (Henle et al. 2010, 2014).
A global terrestrial monitoring program has to provide part of the
infrastructure, guidelines and technical standards needed for successful implementation of biodiversity observation networks and
monitoring programs.

geographical occupation (but see Syfert et al. 2013; Van Strien et al.
2013).
Implementing common monitoring protocols
The adoption of common observation and monitoring protocols
for new programs, together with assimilating existing ones (Allen
et al. 2003; Henry et al. 2008; Lengyel et al. 2008; Schmeller et al.
2009, 2012b), would foster data integration, data interoperability
and indicator extraction. A shortlist of protocols needs to be developed by examining the feasibility and complementarity of what is
currently implemented (Magnusson et al. 2013). From the outset,
plans should be made for systems that will enable the estimation
of frequencies of false absences and the probability of detection
so that data can be integrated across observers and technologies
(e.g. Buckland et al. 2010; MacKenzie et al. 2002). A minimum
requirement would be the delivery of certain data types, such as
the relative numbers of a species in a certain site at a particular
date that can inform different EBVs and is compliant with data standards. Further, at least part of the sampling should cover the area of
interest in a way that is as close to random sampling, including also
stratiﬁed random sampling, to account for regional differences, and
targeted sampling to consider rare species (Ortega et al. 2013). The
sampling strategy employed must be feasible and not concentrated
only where the species is expected to be (Gitzen & Millspaugh 2012;
Gregory et al. 2004; Magnusson et al. 2013).
Developing and optimizing semantics and ontologies for data
interoperability

Implementing minimal data standards to capture EBVs
Primary (raw) occurrence records, such as those stored in the
Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are currently insufﬁcient for the development of EBVs, as only two EBVs (species
distributions and community composition) can be informed by
GBIF data. Observation or locality data on its own is not informative enough, as it does not give a timeframe over which a
species has been sighted (e.g. ﬁve individuals of a species during
one monitoring event). By adding an observation time (e.g. the
maximum number seen simultaneously at one location), the information becomes much more valuable, as it can now be compared
across sites and years (if the monitoring protocol is consistent and
spatially explicit). Additional information is needed to link biodiversity data to habitat management practices, such as a measure
of species assemblage, a standardized habitat description, a georeferenced location, and other data on processes associated with
biodiversity decline. In addition, occurrence or abundance records
need to be used in the context of the relevant sampling framework
and sampling design or else there is a risk that they are misused.
A biodiversity observation network (BON) needs to develop data
collection and metadata standards for the different EBVs in order
to promote the collection of data beyond the triplet species, location and date (Lindenmayer et al. 2012; Pereira et al. 2013). Such
data and databases must then be maintained as both functional and
accessible, which is currently not always the case (Magnusson et al.
2013). Critical to creating value-added indicators from speciespresence data is the addition of complementary information on
species absences and places where a species was searched for, but
not found. Checklist data aggregators, such as eBird are beginning
to ﬁll this gap for selected taxa. This is less of a problem for remotesensing surrogates, but validation of the relationship between these
surrogates and species and habitats they are meant to represent
has only recently been started (Bunce et al. 2013; Nagendra et al.
2013, see also Caro 2010). Without information on the amount of
search effort that is required for registering a species’ presence, it
is usually impossible to robustly evaluate trends in abundance or

Whilst adoption of common protocols would greatly increase
the usability of biodiversity data, it is not practical for existing long-term monitoring programs to change methodologies, as
long time-series using common methodologies are invaluable for
detecting accurate trends in biodiversity status. Techniques for harmonizing data collected with disparate methodologies exist (e.g.
Henry et al. 2008), but sufﬁciently structured, machine-readable
metadata are critical to this integration (Lin et al. 2015). For example, bird densities over much of boreal Canada have been estimated
from multiple disparate data sources by explicitly modelling detection probabilities as functions of distance, duration, vegetation, and
singing-rates (Sólymos et al. 2013). Critical to this type of integration is the capacity to discover and ﬁlter data and metadata from
primary sources (Walls et al. 2014). Whilst there are methodological advances (e.g. Aizpurua et al. 2015; Bird et al. 2014; Pagel et al.
2014), biodiversity scientists capture and assemble data as well as
the semantics of the data in so many ways that it is still necessary
to either improve existing approaches or develop new ones (Walls
et al. 2014). Newer techniques, such as Natural Language Processing
to extract names of species and places from text messages in a citizen science project, might make opportunistically collected data
accessible to scientiﬁc analyses in the future (Lin et al. 2015).
Integrating emerging technologies (monitoring, data management
and analysis)
Technologies, such as remote sensing, camera trap networks
(Rowcliffe et al. 2008, 2011), soundscaping (Pijanowski & Farina
2011), drones (Anderson & Gaston 2013; Koh & Wich 2012),
copter-based transects, phenocams, and radio tracking can help
automate standard observations, decrease long-term monitoring
costs, increase the frequency of assessments, and extend coverage
to remote places, although each comes at a cost and has its own
strengths and weaknesses. Especially remote sensing is developing rapidly (Nagendra et al. 2013) and has the potential to rapidly
increase the coverage of biodiversity monitoring in all realms and

D.S. Schmeller et al. / Journal for Nature Conservation 25 (2015) 51–57

difﬁcult to access ecosystems, e.g. using the L-band in mangrove
monitoring (Lucas et al. 2007, 2014; Ortega et al. 2013). Metagenomics offers the possibility of non-invasive monitoring of whole
assemblages, and data repositories are available for data collected
that may be of use in the future. Adoption of new technologies is
imperative to ﬁll the huge monitoring gaps and to overcome current
biases in monitoring coverage (Balmford et al. 2005; Collen et al.
2008). However, if not properly integrated into a comprehensive
biodiversity observation network, the increasing amount of biodiversity data collected with high-tech tools may not beneﬁt local and
regional BONs. Developments in this sector are rapid (Ortega et al.
2013), and it is important to consider data comparability as many of
the new techniques may soon be outdated, whilst the data collected
with them is of high value. Employed effectively, high-tech biodiversity monitoring tools could boost biodiversity monitoring, both
by complementing ﬁeld-based surveys with desk-based analyses
and by targeting different users and audiences. However, hightech tools also generate large datasets that present challenges for
storage and analysis (see above, capacity building needs).
Coordinating diverse but complementary local nodes
A global species monitoring network needs to offer a platform for dialogue between existing monitoring programs through
fostering the coordination of efforts by regional and national biodiversity observation networks (e.g. Arctic BON, Asia-Paciﬁc BON,
BIOTA; national BONs: ECOSCOPE (France), Countryside survey
(Great Britain), NEM (Netherlands), NILS (Sweden), PPBio (Brazil)).
It is important that these networks explore interoperability and
identify opportunities for integration that will allow a global analysis of the state and trends of biodiversity and to detect globally
relevant patterns. Such integration is challenging because monitoring programs and networks differ in spatial coverage (number
of sites monitored), intensity of information (quantity of data collected per site), and frequency of coverage (number of times a site is
visited in a survey period or per year, or between years). The various
programs contribute differently to the description of patterns and
processes of biodiversity, and are thus highly complementary, but
harmonization might be achieved by global stratiﬁcation to account
for regional differences (Metzger et al. 2013). To track biodiversity trends at the global scale, it will be important to identify all
under-studied regions and taxa. It would be further important to
prioritize future capacity building efforts in those places using e.g.
an approach of national responsibilities and global stratiﬁcation
(Metzger et al. 2013; Schmeller et al. 2008a, 2008b, 2012a, 2014)
or topical priorities (Henle et al. 2013). Protocols used for intensive
studies usually differ from those used in wide-scale surveys. If a
minimum set of common methods were used in both situations,
it would greatly increase the possibilities for integrated analyses
(Costa & Magnusson 2010; Magnusson et al. 2013). A global monitoring program will need to facilitate this process via workshops
and coordination on a global scale.
Providing a common predictive modelling framework
To develop global-scale models with greater predictive power,
GEO BON Terrestrial Species advocates a common modelling
framework. Traditional modelling approaches are insufﬁcient for
modelling changes in ecological systems reliably (Sutherland
2006). Non-linear, ‘tipping point’, or complex feedback loops are
currently the biggest limitations for most modelling approaches
for extrapolating conditions in time and space beyond the boundaries of current knowledge (Evans 2012; Evans et al. 2013; Pereira
et al. 2010b; Polasky et al. 2011). A variety of methods have
been developed for optimizing biodiversity monitoring practices
in terms of survey design (e.g. of sampling methods and frequency)

55

by identifying the most strategic alternatives that allow for accurately detecting and tracking changes whilst minimizing efforts and
resources (e.g. Lindenmayer & Possingham 1996). Also, the more
recently developed predictive mechanistic process-based models,
relating different variables and/or different spatial and temporal
scales (e.g. Harfoot et al. 2014), rely on comprehensive biodiversity information. Extending the use of such predictive modelling
approaches to larger spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales would
be an essential element in deﬁning the best practices for integrative
biodiversity monitoring at the regional or global scale. However,
we currently lack regional-to-global-scale datasets to calibrate and
validate predictive models of change for each of the EBVs. An
improved modelling framework, adoption of a suitable monitoring design, and optimized spatial coverage based on the parameter
and data needs, would lead to reliable predictions and would help
to prioritize conservation planning strategies (Gillson et al. 2013;
Henle et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2006).
Facilitating and securing funding
A solid and long-term ﬁnancial base is critical for maintaining
the structures and institutions that generate, curate and interpret
biodiversity data so that they are functional and effective over
time. Policymakers and stakeholders must recognize that biodiversity data collection, storage and processing require funding. With
strategic organization and coordination, global biodiversity monitoring can be cost-effective (Targetti et al. 2014). Establishment of
national, regional and global ofﬁces to coordinate biodiversity on
the respective scales often necessitates startup funds for building
informatics infrastructures and capacity where needed. Therefore,
one of the goals of GEO BON Terrestrial Species is to engage policymakers in ﬁnding ways to fund biodiversity monitoring that can
serve decision-making in the long-term.
Discussion
Here, we have outlined nine requirements for the successful
development of a global terrestrial species monitoring program.
A global program is urgently needed, as currently most biodiversity data allow the measurement of a few aspects of biodiversity
change only and we only partially understand the relation of biodiversity change to environmental change, especially at global scales.
Whilst there are a number of programs monitoring biodiversity, for
very disparate purposes and using a large variety of methods and
approaches, integrating data from monitoring programs operating on local, regional, national and continental scales has generally
not been achieved. A notable exception is the work on birds and
butterﬂies in North America and in Europe (Butchart et al. 2010;
Gregory & van Strien 2010; Tittensor et al. 2014; van Swaay et al.
2008). More integrative biodiversity monitoring targets at global
scales addressing multiple variables across e.g. the EBV framework, by prioritizing efforts using e.g. stratiﬁcations and matching
complementary monitoring schemes are urgently needed. Critical
thought needs to be given to design future biodiversity monitoring
strategies in order to make sure that data collection can ﬁll existing gaps in the comprehensiveness of biodiversity measurements
(e.g. individual traits and functional interactions). For that, we also
need systematic monitoring of biophysical parameters at biodiversity monitoring sites, which rarely occurs (but see e.g. NEON,
PPBio). This disconnection undermines our ability to determine
the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss, as models cannot be correctly parameterized (Magnusson et al. 2013). Hence,
the nine requirements outlined here aim to lead to the integration
of monitoring programs and would help to ﬁll existing data gaps,
to develop robust predictive models of future change scenarios,

56

and to monitor biodiversity trends on large spatial scales. Such a
comprehensive network might enable scientists and policymakers
to better understand the status and trends of biodiversity and act
accordingly with the interests of both nature and people in mind.
Such a global effort is also important for assessing international
progress in biodiversity conservation and progress towards agreed
conservation targets, such as the Aichi targets of the CBD. Whilst
national, regional, and thematic BONs might serve their respective
geographic scales best, GEO BON Terrestrial Species will need to
focus on global and supraregional patterns and policies. The nine
requirements identiﬁed here represent a pathway for achieving
effective species monitoring on the global scale: our past experience has contributed to identify the main pitfalls targeted by each
of these requirements. We believe that international organization
and political willingness will be necessary to make the best of the
already large but un-coordinated monitoring effort. Rather than
simply a call for more funding, GEO BON Terrestrial Species calls
for the improved coordination and policy support at all scales necessary to improve efﬁciency of current spending on biodiversity
monitoring.
